/**
 * Aggregate browser Host bundle.
 *
 * `BrowserServices` covers the three services a platform package owes Effect —
 * `ChildProcessSpawner`, `FileSystem`, `Path`. This module is the layer above
 * it: the complete closed Host surface `flows` runs on, so the same five tags
 * `NodeHost` and `BunHost` provide are present in a tab too.
 *
 * `Jj` is jj-lib compiled to wasm: the page hands this bundle the compiled
 * `flows_jj.wasm` module and the synchronous half of its filesystem mount, and
 * the bundle wires `BrowserJj.layer` over them — the same operations a Node
 * host gets from the binary, in a tab. The bundle never installs
 * `BrowserJj.layerUnsupported` on its own; a page with no wasm to hand over
 * composes that layer explicitly, so a jj-less host is a stated choice rather
 * than a silent default.
 *
 * Network access is Effect's own `HttpClient` over `fetch` — there is no
 * `flows` wrapper around it. The one thing this bundle configures is
 * `redirect: "manual"`, so the runtime never walks to a second origin behind
 * the capability kernel's back; following a redirect is
 * `@smthrs/kernel`'s guarded `HttpClient.layer`, which rechecks every hop.
 *
 * A tab is stricter than a server about what that leaves visible. Under the
 * Fetch standard, `redirect: "manual"` hands back an *opaque-redirect*
 * response — status `0`, no headers — rather than the 3xx a Node or Bun fetch
 * exposes, so the kernel's redirect loop has no `location` to follow and
 * simply returns it. A redirect therefore fails closed in the browser instead
 * of being followed; it never becomes an unauthorized hop.
