-- The remote cache schema.
--
-- Two stores, not one, exactly as docs/specs/Concepts/Remote Cache.md
-- requires: step-key digest to recorded result, and content digest to bytes.
-- They are separate tables because their publication order matters, and the
-- reference table is what lets eviction respect that order in reverse.
--
-- This is a fresh-install schema, and there is no migration runner. Postgres
-- runs this file once, when it initializes an empty data directory. A volume
-- that was initialized by an earlier version of this file keeps that earlier
-- schema; adopting a change means recreating the volume, which discards the
-- cache. The cache is reconstructible by definition, so that is a restart and
-- not a data loss.

BEGIN;

-- Startup refuses a database initialized by a schema it does not understand.
-- This migration is deliberately fresh-install only; upgrading means replacing
-- the reconstructible cache volume and letting this file initialize it again.

-- Recorded results, keyed by step-key digest.
--
-- `body` is the document the client published, stored verbatim, so a lookup
-- returns the bytes that were written rather than a re-encoding of them. Two
-- clients publish here and their documents differ: RemoteCacheStore sends the
-- CacheStore.CacheEntry envelope, and the smthrs CLI's result cache sends its
-- CachedResult JSON. The service keeps both intact and derives only what SQL
-- has to compare.
--
-- `result_canonical` is that derived discriminator: the entry's `result`
-- member when it has one, otherwise the whole document, rendered with object
-- members in sorted order. Publication conflict is decided on this column, so
-- a re-publication that only reordered its members is identical rather than a
-- reported hermeticity violation.
--
-- Journal provenance is optional because only one of the two clients records
-- it, and it is stored whole or not at all: half a fence would let an eviction
-- naming only a run id delete an entry it never recorded.
--
-- The length bounds are the same bounds the service enforces before the
-- statement runs. They are here as well so a second writer cannot widen them.

-- Release is an explicit verb, never a side effect of a read or a write
-- (docs/specs/Concepts/Reconciliation.md). Nothing in this schema deletes on
-- its own; an operator or a scheduled job calls these two functions, and the
-- returned counts are what a human approves against.
--
-- Use a cutoff older than the longest expected publication. CAS probes update
-- last_accessed_at before the client publishes its cache entry. The grace
-- interval prevents release from winning between those two requests.
--
-- A negative or null budget releases nothing rather than raising: `LIMIT` on a
-- negative value is an error, and an operator who typed one deserves a count
-- of zero, not a half-finished job. A null cutoff also matches no row, because
-- the comparison is null and never true.
--
-- Both functions select their candidates `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, which is
-- how release stays out of the publication protocol's way. A publication holds
-- the entry row it classified until it commits (`FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, in
-- service/storage.js) and holds `FOR KEY SHARE` on every blob it is about to
-- reference. Without SKIP LOCKED a release would block behind those locks, and
-- would report a count it had not finished taking; with it, a row somebody is
-- publishing is simply not a candidate this pass. It stays a candidate for the
-- next one, because releasing is an explicit, repeatable verb.
--
-- The artifact function reads the base table rather than
-- smithers_build_unreferenced_artifact so the locking clause names a real relation.
-- The predicate is the view's predicate; the view stays for inspection.
