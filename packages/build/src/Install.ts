/**
 * The `install` flow: measure, fetch, link.
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Unified Flow Authoring.md` gives two nouns. The atoms
 * here are Actions, because each carries an implementation that is
 * attached separately as a `Layer` and none of them is made of steps. The
 * composite is a Flow, because it has a pure plan-time body and no opaque
 * code of its own.
 *
 * The shape follows Bazel's fetch/build split and rules_js's `npm_translate_lock`
 * split, restated in this vocabulary:
 *
 * | step    | tier   | boundary | admitted to the cross-run cache |
 * | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
 * | measure | sealed | expected | no                              |
 * | fetch/* | sealed | expected | no                              |
 * | link    | sealed | expected | no                              |
 *
 * Every tier is `sealed` because `Plan.compile` refuses to key anything else:
 * `StepKey.fromKeyMaterial` fails with `non_content_material` for
 * `compensable` and `irreversible` declarations, so an `Action` declared at
 * either tier makes the flow unplannable. The `expected` boundary mode is what
 * keeps measure and link out of the cross-run cache, because
 * `ActionPersistence` admits a result only when the tier is `sealed` AND the
 * boundary mode is `hard`. No install action currently uses that mode.
 *
 * A `node_modules` tree is a graph of links into a local store, so
 * restoring one from another machine would produce a tree whose entries point
 * at nothing. Link is therefore never admitted, and measure is not admitted
 * either.
 *
 * ## What measure is, and what it is not
 *
 * Measure reports **content**: the lockfile digest and the credential-free
 * `.npmrc` digest. That is all. It used to report an `Environment` struct that
 * also carried the manager name, the manager version, and the host platform,
 * and the flow ran in two trampoline rounds so a later round could select a
 * manager-specific fetch from a measured manager name.
 *
 * Those three fields were never content. They are the identity of two host
 * services, and they now come from those services:
 *
 * - Which manager, and which version it must be, is
 *   {@link PackageManager.Service}. The workspace declares the version and
 *   `PackageManager.Service.verify` holds the host to it.
 * - The platform is {@link Runtime.Service}. It describes the machine, so it
 *   belongs to the runtime rather than to a struct passed between steps.
 *
 * Two consequences follow. The flow no longer trampolines: the manager arrives
 * in the payload as a plan-time declaration from BUILD.ts, so one round records
 * measure, exactly one fetch, and link. And the cross-round recheck is gone
 * with the second round, replaced by `verify`, which compares the host against
 * what the workspace declared rather than against an earlier measurement of the
 * same host.
 *
 * Measure still exists, and still runs in its own step, because the two digests
 * are step-key material: an install whose lockfile changed must not be answered
 * by the previous install's recorded result.
