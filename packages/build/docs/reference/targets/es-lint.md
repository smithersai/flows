# EsLint

Runs ESLint over declared source sets with a flat config.

```ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"
import { packageManager } from "../../BUILD.ts"

export const lint = Smithers.EsLint({
  packageManager,
  sources: [Smithers.glob("src/**/*.ts")],
  deps: [],
  configs: [Smithers.file("eslint.config.js"), Smithers.file("//eslint.jsdoc.js")],
  maxWarnings: 0,
  fix: false,
  cwd: "packages/flow"
})
```

## Attributes

| Name             | Type                            | Default  | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packageManager` | `PackageManager.PackageManager` | required | The declared package manager the tool runs through; its name and version are key material.               |
| `sources`        | `Array<Input.Declared>`         | required | What to lint. Globs pass through to ESLint as patterns.                                                  |
| `deps`           | `Array<Target.Target>`          | required | Dependency targets. Usually empty: linting sources needs nothing built.                                  |
| `configs`        | `Array<Input.File>`             | required | Flat configs. The first is passed as `--config`; the rest are key material for files the config imports. |
| `maxWarnings`    | `number`                        | required | The warning budget, passed as `--max-warnings`.                                                          |
| `fix`            | `boolean`                       | required | Apply autofixes. The target remains non-cacheable in either mode.                                        |
| `cwd`            | `string`                        | `"."`    | Workspace-relative directory the tool runs in.                                                           |

## Command

The argv is `PackageManager.exec` of the declared package manager. With the
pnpm declaration:

```
pnpm exec eslint [--config <configs[0].path>] --max-warnings <maxWarnings> [--fix] <patterns...>
```

ESLint expands glob patterns itself, so the source declarations reduce to
arguments as follows:

| Declaration | Contributes            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `Glob`      | its `pattern` verbatim |
| `File`      | its `path`             |
| `GitDiff`   | nothing                |

## Inputs

Collected from the attrs: every declaration in `sources`, plus every entry in
`configs`.

## Channels

| Channel | Type             |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Success | `Exec.Result`    |
| Error   | `Exec.ExecError` |

## Status

|           |                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kinds     | `lint`                                                       |
| Cacheable | Never; the executable toolchain is not complete key material |
| Executes  | Yes, through `ExecLive`                                      |

## Notes

`StandardPackage` lints the source glob only, not tests. Its flat config declares
no coverage for test files, and ESLint 9 fails on a pattern whose matches are all
unconfigured. A package whose config does cover tests can pass both globs, as
`packages/flow/BUILD.ts` does.
