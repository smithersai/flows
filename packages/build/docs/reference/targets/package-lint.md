# PackageLint

Checks the published package surface with publint, and optionally checks the
packed tarball's types with arethetypeswrong.

```ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"
import { packageManager } from "../../BUILD.ts"

export const packageLint = Smithers.PackageLint({
  packageManager,
  packageJson: Smithers.file("package.json"),
  artifacts: [Smithers.glob("dist/**/*")],
  deps: [lib],
  strict: true,
  pack: true,
  attw: true,
  cwd: "packages/flow"
})
```

## Attributes

| Name             | Type                            | Default  | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packageManager` | `PackageManager.PackageManager` | required | The declared package manager the tool runs through; its name and version are key material. |
| `packageJson`    | `Input.File`                    | required | The manifest being checked. Key material.                                                  |
| `artifacts`      | `Array<Input.Declared>`         | required | Built output declarations, so a rebuild re-keys the check.                                 |
| `deps`           | `Array<Target.Target>`          | required | Dependency targets, usually the build that produced the artifacts.                         |
| `strict`         | `boolean`                       | required | Report publint warnings as errors.                                                         |
| `pack`           | `boolean`                       | required | Let publint pack the package. When false it reads the directory as-is.                     |
| `attw`           | `boolean`                       | required | Also run arethetypeswrong.                                                                 |
| `cwd`            | `string`                        | `"."`    | Workspace-relative directory both tools lint.                                              |

## Commands

Up to two runs, both from `cwd`. The argvs are `PackageManager.exec` of the
declared package manager. With the pnpm declaration:

```
pnpm exec publint [--strict] [--pack false]
pnpm exec attw --pack .
```

`attw --pack .` packs the package and checks the resulting tarball's types. When
`attw` is false, that half of the result is `null`.

## Inputs

Collected from the attrs: `packageJson`, plus every declaration in `artifacts`.

The built files arrive through the `deps` edges. Declaring them as `artifacts`
too is what makes their content part of this target's key.

## Channels

| Channel | Type             |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Success | `PackageReport`  |
| Error   | `Exec.ExecError` |

```ts
PackageReport = { publint: Exec.Result, attw: Exec.Result | null }
```

## Status

|           |                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Kinds     | `lint`                                                       |
| Cacheable | Never; the executable toolchain is not complete key material |
| Executes  | Yes, through `ExecLive`                                      |
