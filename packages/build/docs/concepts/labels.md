# Labels

A label identifies one target. Labels come only from a `BUILD.ts` file's path and
one of its named exports.

```
//packages/flow:lib
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
  package path  target name
```

The package path is the `BUILD.ts` file's directory relative to the workspace
root, in posix form. The target name is the export name.

## Grammar

| Form                | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `//pkg/path:target` | The export `target` in the package at `pkg/path`                    |
| `//pkg/path`        | The default target of the package at `pkg/path`                     |
| `//`                | The default target of the root package                              |
| `//...`             | Every target in the workspace                                       |
| `//pkg/path/...`    | Every target in the subtree rooted at `pkg/path`                    |
| `:target`           | The export `target` in the package containing the current directory |

A label must start with `//` or `:`. Anything else fails with
`label must start with // or :`.

## Package path normalization

Backslashes become forward slashes. Leading and trailing slashes are stripped. An
empty path and `.` both mean the workspace root. A path containing an empty, `.`,
or `..` segment fails with `invalid package path`.

```
//packages/flow      -> packages/flow
//packages/flow/     -> packages/flow
//                   -> (root)
//packages/../flow   -> error
```

## Relative labels

A bare `:target` resolves in the package containing the current working
directory, computed relative to the workspace root.

```sh
cd packages/flow
smthrs test :test    # //packages/flow:test
```

If the current directory is outside the workspace, or `--workspace` points
elsewhere, the current package falls back to the workspace root. A directory that
is genuinely outside the workspace fails with
`current directory is outside workspace`.

A `:target` label with a second colon fails with `invalid target label`. A `//`
label with a second colon fails the same way, and `//pkg:` with an empty name
fails with `target name is empty`.

## Package defaults

`//pkg` with no target selects the package's default. The workspace tries, in
order:

1. `lib`
2. `nodeModules`
3. The package directory's basename
4. `default`

If none of those exist and the package exports exactly one target, that target is
the default. Otherwise the label fails with
`package //<path> has no unambiguous default target`.

The root install target is conventionally named `nodeModules`, which is why `//`
resolves to it in a workspace laid out like the flows repository.

## Recursive patterns

`//...` and `//pkg/...` select targets rather than one target. They load every
`BUILD.ts` in the selected subtree and return every target those modules export,
plus every target synthesized by a matching default target for a directory in the
subtree without its own `BUILD.ts`.

The prefix is a path prefix, not a glob. `//packages/...` selects
`packages/flow`, `packages/flow/internal`, and every other package beneath
`packages/`.

Recursive patterns are tolerant. A pattern that matches no target for a verb
plans an empty graph. An exact label that does not participate in the verb is an
error, because you named it deliberately.

## Where labels do not appear

Labels never appear in target attributes. A dependency is a direct import of
another `BUILD.ts` file's export, and the imported value is placed in the attrs.
The planner derives the label afterwards, from the module the value was exported
from.

```ts
import { lib as plan } from "../plan/BUILD.ts"

export const lib = TsBuild({ packageManager, deps: [plan] /* ... */ })
```

See [Dependencies](dependencies.md).

## Label derivation

Deriving a label from a target value has two paths.

- The target was already indexed, because its `BUILD.ts` was loaded. The label
  comes from the index.
- The target was reached through a direct import and its module was never loaded
  as a package. The target call recorded its own `BUILD.ts` call-site path from the
  stack at construction time. The workspace loads that module and looks again.

If neither path resolves, the command fails with
`could not derive a label for <target>; export it from a BUILD.ts file`. The fix is
to export the target: a target that no `BUILD.ts` exports has no label.

`API-REVIEW.md` records the stack-derived source path as an open API question.
