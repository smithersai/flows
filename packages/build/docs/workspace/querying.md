# Querying

Two verbs inspect the graph without running anything: `query` lists targets and
evaluates `deps()`, and `graph` renders the dependency graph.

## Listing targets

Pass a label or a pattern.

```sh
smthrs query //...
smthrs query //packages/...
smthrs query //packages/flow:lib
smthrs query :lib
```

The result carries the query string and one entry per target with its label, its
target, and the verbs the target participates in.

```
query: //packages/flow
targets:
  - label: //packages/flow:lib
    target: TsBuild
    kinds: [build]
```

Only the `BUILD.ts` modules the pattern selects are evaluated. `//packages/...`
loads every `BUILD.ts` under `packages/`; `//packages/flow:lib` loads one.

An exact label selects one target, so listing a package prints its default
target, not everything it exports:

```sh
smthrs query //packages/flow      # the default target only
smthrs query //packages/flow/...  # every target in the subtree
```

See [Labels](../concepts/labels.md).

## deps()

`deps(label)` reports the transitive dependency closure of one target.

```sh
smthrs query 'deps(//packages/engine:lib)'
```

```
query: deps(//packages/engine:lib)
root: //packages/engine:lib
dependencies:
  - //packages/flow:lib
  - //packages/plan:lib
edges:
  - from: //packages/plan:lib
    to: //packages/flow:lib
  - from: //packages/flow:lib
    to: //packages/engine:lib
```

`dependencies` is the plan's target list with the root removed. `edges` are the
direct dependency edges the planner recorded, with `from` the dependency and `to`
the dependent.

`deps()` requires an expression that resolves to exactly one root. A recursive
pattern fails with `deps() requires one exact or default target`. Quote the
expression so the shell does not interpret the parentheses.

## Graphs

`graph` plans the pattern under a verb-neutral selection: every target the
pattern matches, regardless of its kinds.

```sh
smthrs graph //packages/engine:lib
```

```
//packages/engine:lib (TsBuild)
└─ //packages/flow:lib (TsBuild)
   └─ //packages/plan:lib (TsBuild)
```

The tree renders each root and recurses into its dependencies. A label the plan
does not contain is marked `[external]`. A label already printed under this root
is marked `[seen]` and not expanded again, so a diamond prints once per path
without looping.

`--mermaid` renders a Mermaid `flowchart LR` instead:

```sh
smthrs graph //packages/... --mermaid
```

```
flowchart LR
  n_2f2f...["//packages/plan:lib\nTsBuild"]
  n_2f2f...["//packages/flow:lib\nTsBuild"]
  n_2f2f... --> n_2f2f...
```

Each node carries the label and the target id separated by a literal `\n`, which
Mermaid renders as a line break. Node ids are the hex encoding of the label, so
they are stable and safe in Mermaid. A double quote inside a label is escaped as
`&quot;`.

The command's structured result also carries `roots`, a flat `targets` list of
`{label, target}`, the `edges`, and `warnings`.

## Patterns

| Pattern        | Selects                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `//pkg:target` | One named export                                          |
| `//pkg`        | The package's default target                              |
| `//pkg/...`    | Every target in the subtree, including synthesized ones   |
| `//...`        | Every target in the workspace                             |
| `:target`      | An export of the package containing the current directory |

Recursive patterns also include targets synthesized by default targets for
directories without a `BUILD.ts`. See
[Workspace structure](structure.md#default-target-synthesis).

## Output format

Both verbs return structured data. The CLI prints TOON by default and accepts
`--json`, `--format yaml`, `--format md`, and `--format jsonl`. Use `--json` when
piping into `jq`:

```sh
smthrs query //... --json | jq -r '.targets[].label'
```
