# Remote caching

Two independent caches carry the word "remote". They store different things,
speak different protocols, and are wired in different places. Read this page
before choosing one.

| Wired by        | `packages/build-cli/src/Cache.ts`, when configured | Not composed by the smthrs CLI today                                           |
| Configured with | Root `RemoteCache`; `SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` overrides | `RemoteCacheStore` and `RemoteArtifacts` layer options                         |

## The CLI result cache remote tier

The root `BUILD.ts` declares the HTTPS endpoint without carrying a credential:

```ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"

export const remoteCache = Smithers.RemoteCache.make({
  endpoint: "https://build.smithers.sh"
})
```

`token` is a `Secret` declaration and defaults to `Secret("SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN")`.
It may name another environment variable, but the bearer-token value must only
arrive through that variable; never put it in `BUILD.ts`. Every tool the CLI
spawns gets an environment with `SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` and the declared token
variable removed, so a target's own commands never see the credential. The
`smthrs` process itself clears the two default names from its own environment
before it loads any `BUILD.ts` file. It does not delete any other variable from
the environment it was given, because the programmatic API runs inside a
caller's process and must not corrupt it.

```sh
export SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN='<token>'
smthrs ci //...
```

`SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` is an optional process override and has precedence over
the declared endpoint. It requires HTTPS except for `http://localhost`,
`http://127.0.0.1`, and `http://[::1]`, which are admitted for a cache running
on the same host.

Behavior:

- A local hit never touches the remote.
- A local miss queries the remote. A remote hit hydrates the local file, so the
  next read stays on disk.
- A put writes both tiers.
- Any remote failure prints one warning line to standard error and degrades the
  store to local-only for the rest of the process. A run never fails because the
  remote cache failed.
- A `PUT` returning `201` inserted the entry, `200` found an identical entry,
  and `409` found a different result under the same key. A `409` warns without
  failing the run or disabling subsequent remote reads.

The client sends the richer action-cache envelope used by the self-hosted
service and accepts either that envelope or the CLI `CachedResult` JSON returned
by older compatible services. Authentication is `Authorization: Bearer`; the
token is never part of the body, a cache key, or a stored entry.

For generated CI, `cacheUrlSecret` optionally emits `SMITHERS_CACHE_URL`, so it
has the same endpoint precedence as local use. `cacheTokenSecret` emits the
bearer token under `cacheTokenEnv`, which defaults to `SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN`.

## The engine step cache services

The flows engine has its own two-store split: `RemoteCacheStore` for keyed step
entries and `RemoteArtifacts` for content-addressed blobs. Both speak one HTTP
protocol.

| Request                  | Behavior                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /ac/{keyDigest}`    | Returns the stored entry JSON, or `404`.                                                              |
| `PUT /ac/{keyDigest}`    | First writer wins: `201` new, `200` identical, `409` different.                                       |
| `DELETE /ac/{keyDigest}` | Deletes an entry. Supplying `recordedRunId` and `recordedEventSeq` together makes it a fenced delete. |
| `GET /cas/{digest}`      | Streams the blob as `application/octet-stream`, or `404`.                                             |
| `PUT /cas/{digest}`      | Hashes the complete upload before publication; a digest mismatch returns `400`.                       |
| `HEAD /cas/{digest}`     | Existence probe.                                                                                      |
| `POST /cas/findMissing`  | Takes `{"digests":[...]}` and returns the missing ones in request order.                              |

Publication order is blobs before metadata: probe with `findMissing`, upload what
is missing, write the local row, then publish the entry. A shared entry must
never be observable while a blob it references is missing.

Both backends enforce the same request bounds before they allocate anything, and
both refuse the same way:

| Bound                                          | Refusal |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `PUT /ac` body, 1 MiB                          | `413`   |
| `PUT /cas` body, the configured artifact bound | `413`   |
| `POST /cas/findMissing` body, 256 KiB          | `413`   |
| `POST /cas/findMissing` digests, 1000          | `413`   |
| `Content-Length` that is not a decimal count   | `400`   |
| Body that is not UTF-8 JSON                    | `400`   |
| Wrong content type                             | `415`   |
| Malformed percent-encoding in the path         | `400`   |

`PUT /ac` requires `application/json` or a `+json` media type, and `PUT /cas`
requires `application/octet-stream`. The bound is enforced against the stream, so
a chunked upload that declares no length is refused at the same point as one that
declares a false length. A storage failure is always `503`, never a `404`: the
client retries a refusal and must never read one as a miss.

An action-cache document is stored and returned verbatim. Two shapes are
accepted: the `CacheEntry` envelope `RemoteCacheStore` publishes, and the CLI's
bare `CachedResult` JSON. A document is an envelope only when both `keyDigest`
and `result` are present, and the key must match the route. Conflict is decided
on that envelope's `result` and on the whole document otherwise, compared with
object members in sorted order, so a re-publication that only reordered its
members is `200` rather than `409`.

The endpoint and its bearer token arrive as layer construction options. They are
capabilities, so they never enter a step key or the journal.

**The smthrs CLI does not compose these engine layers.** Its target result
cache uses the same `/ac` service directly. `packages/build-cli/src/Executor.ts` builds its
runtime from the install layer, `ExecLive`, the catalog action layers, and an
in-memory flow engine. Using remote engine artifacts still means composing
`RemoteCacheStore` and `RemoteArtifacts` into a flows runtime yourself.

### Self-hosted stack

`terraform/` runs the service on one machine with no cloud account. The module
starts Postgres and a Bun HTTP service on a private Docker network, publishing
only the service port on loopback.

```sh
cd terraform/examples/docker
terraform init
terraform apply \
  -var 'postgres_password=<password>' \
  -var 'auth_token=<token>' \
  -var 'postgres_image=postgres@sha256:<digest>' \
  -var 'bun_image=oven/bun@sha256:<digest>'
```

The module publishes a loopback HTTP endpoint. A local CLI may point
`SMITHERS_CACHE_URL` at it directly; put TLS in front of it before using it in a
checked-in `RemoteCache` declaration, because declarations require HTTPS.
Engine layers may also use the module output directly on the trusted local
host.

Terraform deployments require an `auth_token` of 16-4096 printable ASCII
characters and immutable `name@sha256:digest` references for both container
images. `postgres_password` must be at least 12 characters; ports and
`max_body_bytes` must be integers, and one artifact is capped at 16 MiB. The
service still supports an empty token when run directly for development, but
then it binds itself to `127.0.0.1`; the Terraform module never enables that
mode. Startup validates the same values, checks the database schema version
before binding, and refuses a bad configuration rather than turning it into a
request-time `503`. `/healthz` is unauthenticated so the container runtime can
probe it, but it performs a database/schema readiness check and reveals no
cache state.

The service admits at most 64 cache requests at once and, within that bound,
at most four action publications, eight `findMissing` requests, and two large
artifact uploads or downloads. Excess work receives `429` with
`Retry-After: 1`; refused request bodies are cancelled without waiting for a
hostile cancellation promise. The Terraform container is limited to 256 MiB with no swap,
runs as the image's unprivileged user on a read-only root filesystem, drops all
Linux capabilities, and enables `no-new-privileges`. Postgres is limited to
512 MiB with no swap, and the service's SQL pool uses at most eight connections.

Terraform marks credentials and the database URL sensitive, which suppresses
ordinary CLI display but does not encrypt Terraform state or Docker container
inspection output. Keep state in an encrypted, access-controlled backend and
restrict access to the Docker daemon. For a managed production deployment,
inject credentials through the platform's secret manager instead of treating
this local Docker module as a secret-distribution system.

The Postgres schema lives in `terraform/modules/cache/migrations/0001_initial.sql`:
`smithers_build_cache_entry` for step entries, `smithers_build_artifact` for blobs,
`smithers_build_cache_entry_artifact` for references, and two explicit release functions
for eviction. Nothing deletes on its own. An entry row keeps the published
document in `body`, its conflict discriminator in `result_canonical`, and journal
provenance in `recorded_run_id` and `recorded_event_seq`, which are null together
for a client that publishes none and are what a fenced `DELETE` compares.

There is no in-place migration runner. Postgres applies that file once, when it
initializes an empty data directory, so a change to it reaches an existing
deployment only by recreating the `<name_prefix>-cache-pgdata` volume. That
discards the cache, which is reconstructible by definition. The service checks
`smithers_build_cache_schema` before listening, so an old volume fails closed rather
than running new code against an old layout.

The service is `terraform/modules/cache/service`: `protocol.js` is the protocol,
`storage.js` is its Postgres translation, `config.js` is the environment
contract, and `server.js` is startup and nothing else. Its tests run without a
database or a listener:

```sh
cd terraform/modules/cache/service
bun test
```

Publishing an entry is one transaction at Postgres' default `READ COMMITTED`
isolation. It takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock folded from the key,
which serializes every publisher of that key, and it holds the row it
classified with `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` until it commits. That is what makes the
`201`, `200`, and `409` a claim about a row that still exists when the client
reads the answer, and what keeps one publication's artifact references off
another's result. The two release functions select their candidates
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so eviction never blocks behind a publication and
never reports a count it did not take. `storage.js` states the assumptions in
full.

Set `SMITHERS_CACHE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to run the same storage against a real
Postgres, which is the only thing that checks the locking statements and the
schema rather than a fake of them. Point it at a throwaway database: setup
drops and recreates every `smithers_build_` object the migration defines.

```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 55432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=smithers_build_cache_test --name smithers-build-cache-test \
  'postgres@sha256:<digest>'
SMITHERS_CACHE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@127.0.0.1:55432/smithers_build_cache_test \
  bun test
```

```sh
terraform destroy
```

removes the containers and the named cache volume.

### Hosted stack

`infra/` deploys the same protocol to Cloudflare with Alchemy: a Worker storing
action-cache JSON in D1 and blobs in R2, served at `https://build.smithers.sh`.

```sh
cd infra
npm ci --ignore-scripts
export SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
CI=1 npx alchemy plan alchemy.run.ts --stage prod
CI=1 npm run deploy -- --yes
```

`GET` and `HEAD /healthz` are public readiness probes over D1 and R2 and reveal
no cache state. Every `/ac` and `/cas` route requires the bearer token. A client
switches between the hosted and self-hosted services by changing the endpoint
and token; cache keys and payloads do not change. Hosted migrations live in
`infra/worker/migrations/`; the second migration bounds legacy and future D1
rows before the Worker serves them.

## The current engine boundary

Fetch declares `.flows/store/<manager>` as a `TreeArtifact`. The shipped
filesystem boundary can execute that action, capture the declared tree, and
replay it locally. It cannot attest that the process wrote nowhere else, so it
omits the whole-tree and hermetic-read proofs and its evidence stays run-local.

The consequence is concrete: no fetch result is admitted to the shared tier
today. The action is designed to be admissible, and becomes admissible when the
sandbox execution lane supplies those proofs. This is an engine wiring
limitation, not a second cache protocol.

The same caveat does not apply to the CLI result cache. It stores a JSON success
value under a planner content key, publishes no artifacts, and makes no
hermeticity claim.
