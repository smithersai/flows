# What is smithers build

smithers build orchestrates builds for TypeScript workspaces. It borrows Bazel's model:
a workspace is a set of packages, a package declares targets, a target names its
inputs and its dependencies, and a verb selects a set of targets to run.

The difference is the authoring language. A `BUILD.ts` file is a plain TypeScript
module. Its named exports are targets. There is no new configuration dialect, no
Starlark, and no JSON pipeline file.

```ts
// packages/flow/BUILD.ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"
import { packageManager } from "../../BUILD.ts"

export const { lib, test, lint } = Smithers.StandardPackage({
  packageManager,
  deps: [],
  cwd: "packages/flow"
})
```

That file declares three targets: `//packages/flow:lib`, `//packages/flow:test`,
and `//packages/flow:lint`.

## Everything is a flow

A target call returns a [flow](https://github.com/smithersai/flows): a declaration
with a schema-typed payload, a schema-typed success value, a schema-typed error
channel, and a pure plan-time body. smithers build attaches planner metadata to that
flow under a symbol, which makes it a target.

Three consequences follow.

- **Module evaluation performs no I/O.** `file()` and `glob()` return inert
  values. The target body records plan nodes and runs nothing. Reading the
  filesystem happens later, in the planner, and running tools happens later
  still, in the engine.
- **Every step is keyed.** A target body records action calls. The engine derives a
  content key for each one from its payload, its declared effects, its resolved
  layers, and its capability ceiling.
- **Host access is a layer.** Spawning a process, writing a file, and calling a
  model are all actions whose implementations arrive as Effect layers. Swapping
  npm for pnpm is a layer swap, not a branch.

[Actions and boundaries](../concepts/actions-and-boundaries.md).

smithers build takes Bazel's target model and label grammar, Turborepo's presentation
and workspace assumptions, and the flows engine's keying and durability model.
It does not sandbox actions today, so its hermeticity guarantee is weaker than
Bazel's. See [Actions and boundaries](../concepts/actions-and-boundaries.md).

## The three packages

| `@smthrs/build`     | `packages/build/src/`     | Dependency installation as flows. Exports `Install` and `PackageManager`.                                                                    |
| `@smthrs/targets`   | `packages/targets/src/`   | The `BUILD.ts` authoring surface: `Target.make`, `Input`, `Workspace`, `PackageDefaults`, `Exec`, `StandardPackage`, and the target catalog. |
| `@smthrs/build-cli` | `packages/build-cli/src/` | The `smthrs` CLI: workspace discovery, the planner, the executor, the cache, and query and graph output.                                     |
