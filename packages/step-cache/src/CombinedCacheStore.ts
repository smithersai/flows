/**
 * Two step-result tiers composed into one: local first, remote second, with
 * write-back into the local SQL store.
 *
 * The shape is Bazel's `CombinedCache.downloadActionResult`
 * (`reference/bazel/.../remote/CombinedCache.java`, lines 230-303): consult the
 * disk cache, fall back to the remote cache only on a miss, and write what the
 * remote returned back into the disk cache so the next lookup is local.
 *
 * **Publication order is the caller's job, not this store's.** A cache entry
 * must never be observable in the shared tier while an artifact it references
 * is missing from the shared artifact tier — Bazel's REAPI ordering constraint
 * at `UploadManifest.java:630-633`, stated there as "action results may fail to
 * validate server-side if they are accessed before all blobs they refer to are
 * present". `@smthrs/engine-store`'s `ArtifactSync` enforces it around
 * `put`. This module cannot: it does not know what an entry references.
 *
 * *When* the shared copy is written is configurable for the same reason — see
 * {@link Options.publication}. A caller holding a write transaction takes
 * `"deferred"` and publishes afterwards.
