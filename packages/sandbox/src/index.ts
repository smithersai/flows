/**
 * @since 0.1.0
 *
 * `@smthrs/sandbox` — remote process execution and sandbox liveness.
 *
 * Modules are re-exported as namespaces, the way `effect`'s own index does it,
 * so each keeps its `make` / `makeNoop` / `layerNoop` trio without colliding
 * with its neighbour.
 *
 * The package is **platform-neutral and browser-bundleable**: it adapts a
 * provider a caller hands it onto Effect's `ChildProcessSpawner` contract and
 * owns no host access of its own. `scripts/browser-check.mjs` at the repository
 * root pins that property.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { RemoteChildProcessSpawner, SandboxHealth } from "@smthrs/sandbox"
 * ```
