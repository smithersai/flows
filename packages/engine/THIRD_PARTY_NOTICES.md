## Effect (`Effect-TS/effect`)

`@smthrs/engine` is a fork of Effect's unstable durable-flow runtime and
contains substantial portions of that source. The fork point, upstream package
version, and a module-by-module record of what was vendored and how it was
changed are documented in `packages/engine/VENDOR.md`:

- Upstream repository: `Effect-TS/effect`
- Upstream commit: `23e176a4f05ed3e81cc13a5d70111099692ea9a5`
- Upstream package: `effect@4.0.0-beta.102`
- Upstream source: `packages/effect/src/unstable/workflow`
- Vendored modules: `Flow.ts`, `Activity.ts`, `FlowEngine.ts`,
  `DurableClock.ts`, `DurableDeferred.ts`, `DurableQueue.ts`, `FlowProxy.ts`,
  `FlowProxyServer.ts`, and `index.ts`

Every `@smthrs/*` package also depends on Effect at runtime, so the notice
