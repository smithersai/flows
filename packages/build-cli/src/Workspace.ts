 * Ensures the root `.gitignore` ignores the resolved cache directory.
 *
 * The write is idempotent: any of the four equivalent entry spellings already
 * present leaves the file untouched, and a missing `.gitignore` is created
 * with the entry alone.
 *
 * Publication reuses {@link writeGeneratedFile}, the same atomic writer every
 * generated file goes through, so the whole file appears at once: contents go
 * to an exclusively created sibling temp that is written, fsynced, and closed
 * before the rename, the existing file's permission bits are preserved, a
 * failed close never publishes as success, and a temp is never leaked
 * silently. `Exec.resolveWorkspacePath` refuses a path that leaves the
 * workspace once symbolic links resolve.
 *
 * ## Boundary
 *
 * This is read-modify-write with no compare-and-swap: the filesystem offers no
 * portable way to publish a file only if it still holds the bytes that were
 * read. Two processes racing here both read the same file and both publish a
 * whole, valid file, and the last rename wins. Because every writer derives
 * the same contents from the same base, the loser's result is byte-identical
 * to the winner's; a reader can never observe a partial or interleaved file.
 * An unrelated edit that lands between this read and this write is the case
 * that would be lost, which is why the write only ever happens when the entry
 * is genuinely absent.
