/**

 *
 * Rendering an `effect/unstable/process` `Command` back to a shell command
 * line.
 *
 * Two callers need the same string and must agree on it exactly:
 *
 *  1. `@smthrs/kernel/ChildProcessSpawner` uses it as the `proc:spawn`
 *     capability resource, so a grant reads the way an operator wrote it; and
 *  2. `@smthrs/platform-browser/BrowserChildProcessSpawner` uses it as the line
 *     it hands to the in-browser bash interpreter, which has no `argv` to spawn
 *     with.
 *
 * A single renderer keeps a granted capability and the command a browser
 * actually runs from drifting apart.
 *
 * The module is pure string handling — no host access — so it stays on the
 * browser-safe side of the package.

/**
 * Renders a `Command` as a single shell command line.
 *
 * A standard command with `shell: true` renders its tokens verbatim, matching
 * the line Node and the browser interpreter hand to the default shell. A
 * custom shell renders as an explicit `<shell> -c <line>` invocation so the
 * selected executable is part of the permission resource. Without `shell`,
 * every token is POSIX-quoted to preserve literal argv semantics. These
 * distinctions are security-sensitive: the rendered value is also the
 * `proc:spawn` capability resource, so it must describe what will execute.
 * The rendering is POSIX-only by contract: on Windows, Node invokes the shell
 * with `/d /s /c` rather than `-c`, so the rendered line describes the POSIX
 * invocation, not a cmd.exe one.
 *
 * A `PipedCommand` renders with `|` between its sides. That is a faithful
 * rendering of what the pipeline does, and it is the only form an interpreter
 * that takes a command line rather than an `argv` can be given. `from`/`to`
 * pipe options are *not* expressible this way; rendering ignores them, so a
 * pipeline that redirects `stderr` renders like one that pipes `stdout`.
 * Capability checks therefore see the commands, never the plumbing.
