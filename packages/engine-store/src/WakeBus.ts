/**
 * The in-process wake bus: durable writes that make a run runnable — a
 * deferred completed, a durable clock fired, an operator resume — announce
 * the run id here, and in-process waiters parked on that run resume
 * immediately instead of waiting out a poll tick.
 *
 * The bus is EDGE-TRIGGERED and MISS-TOLERANT by design. A wake published
 * while nobody waits is dropped, not queued: durable state already records
 * that the run is runnable, and the engine's suspension polling schedule
 * (`suspendedRetryPolicy`) remains the bounded fallback that re-drives any
 * run whose wake the bus missed. Temporal's scheduled task queue takes the
 * same position — `NotifyNewTasks` is a coalesced, non-blocking channel send
 * and `MaxPollInterval` bounds the polling fallback (`reference/temporal`
 * `service/history/queues/queue_scheduled.go`) — because a lossless bus
 * would have to be durable, and the durable record already exists. Waiter
 * registration follows opencode's in-process job registry: one `Deferred`
 * per waiter, succeeded on completion, removed when the waiter's own scope
 * closes (`reference/opencode` `packages/core/src/background-job.ts`).
 *
 * Cross-process wakes never reach this bus: another process's deferred
 * completion is observed through the store, on the polling schedule and the
 * heartbeat sweeps. That split is deliberate v1 scope — an event-driven
 * cross-process wake needs a committed journal subscription, which is a
 * separate seam.
 *
 * The bus holds no host access at all — a `Map` of `Deferred`s — so it is
 * browser-safe without a platform layer.
