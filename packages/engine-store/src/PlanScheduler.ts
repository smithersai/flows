/**
 * Drives a persisted plan: the node scheduler.
 *
 * `@smthrs/plan` makes the plan a value; this makes it run. The scheduler
 * walks the persisted graph, dispatches ready nodes through the same
 * `internal/ActionPersistence` seam every action uses — so the shared step
 * cache, the workspace sandbox's execute→materialize transaction, attempt
 * rows, and the fenced journal all apply unchanged — and records an
 * evaluation outcome per node.
 *
 * ## What it is, and what it is not
 *
 * Skyframe's `AbstractParallelEvaluator` is the prior art for the state
 * machine (`CHECK_DEPENDENCIES → VERIFIED_CLEAN | NEEDS_REBUILDING →
 * REBUILDING → DONE`) and `EvaluationProgressReceiver` for the outcome
 * vocabulary. Two deliberate deviations:
 *
 * 1. **No reverse-dependency index, no invalidating node visitor.**
 *    `docs/specs/Concepts/Engine Hardening Round 1.md` rejects both outright:
 *    content addressing subsumes them. A node is "dirty" iff the key it would
 *    dispatch under differs from the one it dispatched under, and the
 *    dispatch-time recheck already computes that. There is no dirty bit to
 *    propagate, so there is nothing for a visitor to walk.
 * 2. **Completion-driven, without Skyframe restarts.** Skyframe atomically
 *    signals reverse dependencies when one node settles. Our dependencies are
 *    declared in the plan before anything runs, so one coordinator can make
 *    the equivalent decision from the plan, settled state, and scheduling
 *    permits: every completion is reconciled and immediately opens another
 *    admission pass. Giving up the wavefront barrier also gives up its
 *    trivially serialized reconciliation; draining and applying the durable
 *    deviation journal after each settlement, before reevaluating downstream
 *    readiness, restores that ordering without holding unrelated ready cones.
 *    The coordinator is the sole writer of scheduling state, which keeps every
 *    admission decision deterministic without the `DeterministicHelper` the
 *    vault rejected.
 *
 * ## The three limits
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Concurrency.md` insists the same number must never
 * stand in for graph width, scheduler admission, and provider capacity. This
 * module owns the middle one only: `concurrency.steps` is the leaf-execution
 * cap, and `concurrency.agents` is the subset cap an agent node consumes in
 * addition. Structural width is whatever the plan says; seats belong to
 * `Agent Adapters` and are not modelled here.
 *
 * Under contention, ready work is ordered by effective priority — declared
 * `priority` plus one point per capacity-constrained admission pass. A ready
 * node gains a point exactly when a pass considers it but cannot give it the
 * required permits. Aging is what lets priority change latency without
 * permitting starvation; equal effective priorities preserve deterministic
 * plan order.
 *
 * ## Observing the world exactly once
 *
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Staleness.md`'s torn-run rule: never re-observe the
 * world mid-run. Paths the plan reads but no node writes are **source** paths;
 * they are measured once, before the first dispatch, and pinned for the rest
 * of the run. Paths a node in the plan produces are measured after their
 * producer settles — observing our own output, not the world.

       *    out. Every deviation on the page is attributed first, so both sides
       *    of a pair see each other.

       *    journal more records than one page holds, and the final completion
       *    is the one that matters: nothing follows it to pick up what a single
