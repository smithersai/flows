/**
 * The two-tier step-cache protocol, extracted out of `ActionPersistence`.
 *
 * `ActionPersistence` owns *when* a result may be shared — sealed tier, hard
 * boundary, no deviation, verified read set. This module owns *how* it becomes
 * shareable and how a shared hit is made replayable, which is the half a
 * two-tier composition has to be able to inject into:
 *
 * - {@link publishArtifacts} runs before the cache entry is written, so an
 *   entry is never observable while an artifact it references is missing
 *   (`reference/bazel/.../remote/UploadManifest.java:630-633`).
 * - {@link publishEntry} runs after the transaction that made the local row
 *   durable, so the shared entry lands last of all — and outside the write
 *   transaction.
 * - {@link hydrateArtifacts} runs after a replay refused for a *missing*
 *   artifact — the one refusal a shared tier can repair — so the replay is
 *   retried once against fetched bytes instead of falling straight through to
 *   a real execution.
 *
 * The seams are `ArtifactSync` and `CacheSync`, both resolved optionally: a
 * composition with no shared tier gets the `makeLocal()` implementations, whose
 * publish steps are no-ops and whose `hydrate` reports nothing was fetched.
 * That is why a purely local engine pays nothing for this file.
 *
 * Every host call here stays OUTSIDE the `DurableWriter` transaction, like the
 * Jj snapshot and the boundary prepare/settle: a host call must never be held
 * across a write transaction.
 *
 * Neither publication step can fail a run. A shared cache is an accelerator,
 * and by the time these run the result is already durably recorded on this
 * host — failing a completed run because an optional tier is unreachable trades
 * a real result for an unavailable one. Both report the refusal instead, and
 * the caller journals it, exactly as an unverified read set is journaled rather
 * than swallowed.
