/**
 * The in-process attempt admission mutex.
 *
 * One instance lives per store incarnation (per `EngineStore.make`, alongside
 * the owner nonce). Every durable action dispatch holds the key's permit
 * for its whole admission-execute-finish span, so at most one fiber of this
 * process can be driving a given `(runId, stepKeyDigest, attempt)` at a time.
 *
 * That exclusion is the liveness evidence adoption needs (issues #86, #102,
 * #103): a persisted `running` row observed *while holding the key's permit*
 * cannot belong to a live fiber of this process — a live same-key dispatch
 * would be holding the permit — so it is crash or interruption evidence and
 * safe to adopt, whether the admitting incarnation was another process
 * (superseded by the run fence) or this very one (a dead fiber after an
 * in-process re-drive). The recorded incarnation nonce alone could not make
 * that distinction, which both let a TOCTOU window double-execute an
 * irreversible body (issue #102) and permanently failed a same-incarnation
 * re-drive with `AttemptAdmissionRejected` (issue #103).
