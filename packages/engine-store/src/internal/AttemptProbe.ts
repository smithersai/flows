 * A retention/prune job removes attempts oldest-first, so a surviving
 * sequence is contiguous once its first row is found; the bound caps the
 * pruned prefix walk (issue #69). It is a *semantic* bound, not merely a
 * cost bound: the point-probe fallback cannot distinguish "nothing ever ran"
 * from "the first 33 attempts were pruned" without a range read, so both
 * paths apply the same tolerance and a key whose earliest survivor sits past
 * it restarts its expiration budget and attempt numbering on either backend
 * (issue #96). Restarting is safe — the pruned numbers are gone, so the
 * fresh counter cannot collide — and, unlike the previous split, it is the
 * same behaviour on every backend.
