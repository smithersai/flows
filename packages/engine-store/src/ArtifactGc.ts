/**
 * Mark/sweep garbage collection for the content-addressed artifact store.
 *
 * The artifact tier is the one store in the composition with true *garbage*:
 * every output over the inline bound is spilled to `.flows/objects` by digest
 * (`StepBoundary`), nothing ever deletes a published blob, and a blob whose
 * every referencing row is gone is unreachable forever. The step cache is
 * deliberately NOT collected here — its rows are the *roots* of this graph,
 * they never become unreachable, and removing one is the policy decision
 * `CacheStore.evict` already serves.
 *
 * The design combines the two prior arts on the shelf:
 *
 * - **Reachability from durable roots** — git's `git gc` marks from refs;
 *   Skyframe deletes what a keyed graph walk cannot reach. Here the roots are
 *   every attempt row of every existing (never-deleted) run and every step
 *   cache entry; each carries boundary evidence, and
 *   `StepBoundary.referencedDigests` names the blobs that evidence needs.
 *   Attempt checkpoints are roots too: they are opaque executable state, so
 *   the mark keeps digest-shaped strings found in their JSON.
 * - **A grace period over mtime** — git refuses to prune unreachable objects
 *   younger than `gc.pruneExpire` (two weeks), jj keeps operations newer than
 *   its keep bound, and Bazel's disk-cache collector
 *   (`reference/bazel/.../remote/disk/DiskCacheGarbageCollector.java`) fences
 *   on mtime. The grace period is what protects a writer racing the
 *   collector: a blob published — or freshened by a dedupe `put` — after the
 *   mark began carries a fresh mtime and survives, no lock required.
 *
 * Collection NEVER runs automatically. `gc()` is an explicit verb, exactly as
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Reconciliation.md` requires of every deletion —
 * "deletion is the irreversible direction", and a human approving a plan must
 * be approving the deletions too. The opt-in {@link ArtifactGcPolicy} layer
 * configures *how* an invocation collects (grace bound, pinned digests); it
 * does not schedule anything.

 * fresh publication carries a fresh mtime, a re-publication of existing bytes
 * freshens the blob's mtime (`ArtifactStore.put`), and the sweep's deletion
 * is fenced on that mtime (`ArtifactSweep.remove`'s `ifUnmodifiedSinceMs`).
