/**
 * Standard metric definitions for the engine-store hot paths.

 * This module only defines the metric handles, following the shape of
 * `RunStoreMetrics` and Effect's `ClusterMetrics`. The dispatch seam
 * (`internal/ActionPersistence`), the plan scheduler, the workspace sandbox,
 * and the run driver update them as outcomes are decided. No exporter ships in
 * this package; provide one — for example `@smthrs/observability` — and
 * these series appear in it.
 *
 * Counters over an effect's exit are keyed by {@link ExitTag} records, so an
 * update is a lookup rather than a branch, and durations land in
 * `Metric.timer` histograms through Effect's own `Effect.trackDuration`. The
 * same exit observation annotates the operation span with its outcome; none of
 * the instrumentation combinators alters the instrumented effect's result or
 * cause.
