/**
 * Pure, pipeable nodes: the shape a flow body describes and nothing more.
 *
 * Building a node records an inspectable AST and executes nothing — the same
 * split as Bazel's `ctx.actions.run`, which declares an action rather than
 * running one (`docs/specs/Concepts/Unified Flow Authoring.md`). A plan is
 * always a DAG, so there is no loop node here and never will be: repetition
 * lives one level up, in what a flow settles with
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Trampoline Loops.md`).
 *
 * A node also carries Effect's requirement channel, `R`, and carries it as a
 * PHANTOM: building a plan demands nothing, and every combinator here unions
 * `R` without ever reading it. What fills the channel is a call to something
 * whose code lives elsewhere — an action — so the type of a plan states which
 * implementations executing it will need, and the place that executes it is
 * where the compiler asks for them.
 *
 * Control flow is structure. {@link branch} takes both arms and evaluates each
 * ONCE, symbolically, so the exit condition and the handoff site are visible
 * topology before anything runs; its predicate is digested and runs later on
 * the real value. {@link map} is transformation only. The rule the authoring
 * note states, and this module encodes: **map transforms; branch decides.**
 *
 * Adapted from the agent repo's `@smthrs/core` `Node.ts`. `Dynamic` is gone —
 * a model call is an ordinary action, and nothing model-shaped belongs in
 * this package — and node annotations are gone with it, because the AST has to
 * stay JSON serializable.
