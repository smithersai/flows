/**
 * Persisted plan schema migrations.
 *
 * This package owns `flows_plans`, `flows_plan_nodes`, and `flows_plan_edges`
 * and nothing else. It reserves migration id block `4000` — the next free
 * block after the journal (`0`), the run store (`1000`), the step cache
 * (`2000`), and the engine store (`3000`) — so its first migration is id
 * `4001`. See `@smthrs/database`'s `Migrations` for how the blocks compose and
 * why a set landing at or below the applied high-water mark is rejected rather
 * than silently assumed done.
 *
 * Derived contracts: `docs/specs/Specs/Plan.md` and
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Split.md`.
