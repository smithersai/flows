/**
 * The KeyMaterial → step-key compiler.
 *
 * Revived from the module deleted at `f5f3dda` (then
 * `packages/keys/src/StepKey.ts`). Two deliberate deviations from the original:
 *
 * 1. **It lives here, not in `@smthrs/keys`.** That package was reduced to the
 *    single `Key` transformation on purpose; a compiler that understands plan
 *    material belongs above it.
 * 2. **It produces `@smthrs/keys` `Key` values, not a second `sk1_` digest
 *    format.** The original minted its own prefix over a private `Digest`
 *    module. The engine dispatches under `Key` (`FlowEngine/ActionKey.ts`),
 *    so a plan whose node keys were a *different* string format could never be
 *    the thing the cache is consulted against — and that is the whole point of
 *    `docs/specs/Specs/Object Model.md`'s `Plan`. One key format, one hashing
 *    chokepoint (canonical JSON + injected `Crypto`), one namespace field
 *    (`kind`) distinguishing content keys from ordinal ones.
 *
 * Everything the original earned is kept: nominally branded digest inputs (a
 * literal that merely *looks* like `{digest}` hashes as a literal), set
 * normalization, the separate environment namespace, per-variant tagging of
 * resolved references, and the hashed `version`.
 *
 * Governing contract: `docs/specs/Concepts/Step Keys.md`.
