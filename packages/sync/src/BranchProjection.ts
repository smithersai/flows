/**
 * The branch document projection: journal entries folded into what two people
 * looking at the same branch must agree on.
 *
 * The fold is order-independent over the canonical entry set, which is what
 * makes convergence a property rather than a hope: any two clients that have
 * applied the same set of entries hold the same state, regardless of the
 * order their transports delivered frames in or how many times a frame
 * arrived.
 *
 * Three guards do all the work, and each is a production invariant:
 *
 * - entries from another branch's run are ignored, so a mis-routed frame can
 *   never leak into a projection;
 * - an entry already folded — the cursor tip redelivered, or a command id
 *   already applied — is ignored, so an at-least-once transport cannot
 *   double-apply a user action and a reconnect replays no side effects;
 * - an entry below the cursor whose command was never applied is folded into
 *   its canonical `seq` position, so out-of-order delivery converges on the
 *   same document instead of permanently dropping the late entry.
