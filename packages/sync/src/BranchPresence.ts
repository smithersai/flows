/**
 * Ephemeral presence and cursors for one shared branch.

 * Presence is deliberately NOT journalled. A roster is a lease table: every
 * announcement extends a lease, and a participant that stops announcing —
 * because the tab closed, the network dropped, or the process died — ages out
 * without anyone reporting the disconnect. Writing presence to the journal
 * would make "who was looking at this" part of the durable, replayable history
 * of a run, which is both unbounded and wrong: replaying a branch must not
 * resurrect a stranger's caret.
 *
 * Every operation authorizes through {@link BranchShare}, so a capability for
 * one branch can neither read nor write another branch's roster.
