/**
 * Standard metric definitions for the durable write boundary.
 *
 * This module only defines the metric handles, following the shape of Effect's
 * `ClusterMetrics`. `DurableWriter`'s retry policy updates them, so every
 * store that writes through the boundary — journal, run store, step cache,
 * engine state — lands in the same counter. No exporter ships in this
 * package; provide one — for example `@smthrs/observability` — and the
 * counter appears in it.

 * write contention. The attempt that finally fails past the retry budget is
 * not counted; it surfaces on the error channel instead.
