/**
 * Trampoline lineage columns on `flows_runs`.
 *
 * Governing design: `docs/specs/Concepts/Trampoline Loops.md`. A round is its
 * own run row, chained to the previous round through the `parent_run_id`
 * column this table already reserved for continue-as-new, and these two
 * columns are what make the chain readable as a lineage rather than as an
 * anonymous ancestry: which lineage a round belongs to, and which round of it
 * this is. They are NOT `flows_run_parents` edges — that table is the subflow
 * DAG cycle detection walks, and a lineage is a chain of successive
 * executions of one run rather than a parent spawning a child.
 *
 * Append-only, as every migration after the first must be: both columns are
 * nullable, so every row an earlier build wrote stays valid and reads back as
 * "round 0 of its own lineage".
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
