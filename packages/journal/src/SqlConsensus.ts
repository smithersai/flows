/**
 * The default database-backed consensus strategy.
 *
 * This is today's `flows_runs` ownership compare-and-swap relocated: the
 * owner tuple, the two-phase claim columns, `recoverClaim`, and the grant
 * timestamp become the private schema of one strategy — the
 * `flows_consensus_leases` table — instead of a public contract.
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Run Ownership.md`'s mechanism section is its
 * specification.
 *
 * Commit-time admission (R3) is exact: `guard` is a plain SELECT that joins
 * the caller's open write transaction — `DurableWriter` serializes write
 * transactions, so no reclaim can commit between the guard read and the
 * statements beside it — and every mutating operation runs through
 * `DurableWriter.write`, joining an enclosing transaction as a savepoint.
 * Prior art: Temporal's shard `rangeID` check
 * (`reference/temporal/service/history/shard/context_impl.go`,
 * `renewRangeLocked`).
 *
 * Governing design: `docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Consensus.md`.
 *
