/**
 * Durable journal checkpoints and the compaction floor.
 *
 * One row per `(run_id, seq)`: the caller-captured state that replays the run
 * from `seq` without the entries before it. `compacted_at_ms` is NULL until a
 * compaction has truncated the entries strictly below `seq`; the largest
 * compacted `seq` per run is the run's compaction floor, and reads whose
 * cursor starts below it fail with `compacted` instead of returning a
 * silently shortened history.
 *
 * Prior art: Temporal's mutable state is exactly this shape — a durable
 * snapshot pinned to a history offset (`last_first_event_id` in
 * `reference/temporal/proto/internal/temporal/server/api/persistence/v1/executions.proto`),
 * with history below it never replayed.
