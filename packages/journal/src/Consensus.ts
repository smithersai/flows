/**
 * The injectable consensus strategy arbitrating the journal's ownership rules.
 *
 * The journal owns the consensus rules R1–R6 — single writer per run, fenced
 * and unfenced appends, commit-time admission, the generation fence, steal
 * only on staleness plus liveness evidence, and ownership transitions as
 * events — and this service is how a deployment chooses *how* those rules are
 * arbitrated: where the lease lives, how liveness is probed, and how the
 * fence is checked at commit time. `Consensus` lives here beside `OwnerId`
 * for the same reason `OwnerId` does: the journal is what it fences.
 * `@smthrs/run-store`'s `Ownership` keeps its public API and rules but
 * delegates arbitration to this strategy.
 *
 * Every operation that reasons about staleness takes the caller's clock
 * reading (`nowMs`) rather than reading a clock itself: staleness (R5) and
 * the monotonic lease stamp are defined against the arbitrating caller's
 * reading, exactly as `RunStore`'s compare-and-swap operations always were,
 * so the recorded lease never differs from the outcome the caller observed.
 *
 * Governing design: `docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Consensus.md`.
 * Rule constants and their provenance: `docs/specs/Concepts/Run Ownership.md`.
 *
 * Prior art: Effect `EventJournal`
 * (`reference/effect` `unstable/eventlog`) resolves multi-writer by merge
 * with conflict surfacing; driving a run is not mergeable, so this surface
 * deviates to exclusive-writer admission. The fencing and generation
 * semantics follow Temporal's shard `rangeID`
 * (`reference/temporal/service/history/shard/context_impl.go`).

 * clock may already read that much later than the owner's) minus one
 * {@link heartbeatInterval} (the owner only re-evaluates the budget once per
 * pulse, so it may notice the expiry a full tick late).
 *
 * This bounds, but does not eliminate, overlap. Beyond
 * {@link heartbeatSkewAllowance} of clock offset a peer can be admitted while
 * the old owner is still running. *Durable* writes stay safe regardless — they
 * are fenced by the strategy's commit-time admission, so the displaced owner's
 * writes fail rather than corrupt. Non-durable external side effects (an HTTP
 * call, a spawned process) can genuinely overlap. That is inherent to any
 * wall-clock lease and is stated here rather than asserted away; a caller that
 * cannot tolerate any overlap needs an external fencing token at the side
