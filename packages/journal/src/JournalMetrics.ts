/**
 * Standard metric definitions for the journal write path.

 * This module only defines the metric handles, following the shape of Effect's
 * `ClusterMetrics`. `SqlJournal` updates them as emission receipts are
 * produced, so the counters measure admissions on the hot path rather than
 * rows read back. No exporter ships in this package; provide one — for
 * example `@smthrs/observability` — and these counters appear in it.

/**
 * Counter over journal emissions, dimensioned by `channel` (`durable` or
 * `lossy`) and `receipt` (`accepted`, `duplicate`, or `dropped`).
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * A `durable` emission counts when its receipt is produced, which is after the
 * write transaction returned; under `Journal.transact` that is still inside
 * the caller's transaction, so a receipt that later rolls back with the
 * enclosing transaction has already counted. The counter is throughput
 * evidence, not commit evidence — the journal rows themselves are the latter.
