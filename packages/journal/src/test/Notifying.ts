/**
 * Effect-native analogue of Skyframe's `NotifyingHelper` /
 * `NotifyingInMemoryGraph` (see
 * `reference/bazel/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/skyframe/NotifyingHelper.java`):
 * wrap a record-of-Effect-methods service so a listener hook fires around
 * every operation. The hook runs in the calling fiber, so a hook that dies,
 * interrupts, or awaits a `Latch` injects crashes, fence loss, and exact
 * sequencing at any durable transition point — the mechanism that makes
 * interstitial interleaving bugs testable at all.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT ported from Skyframe: `DeterministicHelper`'s
 * deterministic-scheduler machinery, `ChainedFunction`, and `TrackingAwaiter`.
 * Effect already gives us deterministic fibers, `TestClock`, `Latch`, and
 * failure propagation across fiber joins, so those helpers have no residue
 * here.
 *
 * Vault: [[Engine Hardening Round 1]]
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Engine Hardening Round 1.md`), section 7.
 *
 * Governing designs: `docs/specs/Concepts/Run Ownership.md` and the bazel
 * Skyframe audit (test-harness gap).
