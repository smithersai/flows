/**
 * The shared consensus conformance contract.
 *
 * Every strategy implements the same rules R1–R6
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Consensus.md`); none may weaken them. This
 * module states those rules once as executable cases and each strategy's test
 * file instantiates them, the way Bazel's Skyframe pins every evaluator
 * implementation against one `GraphTester` harness
 * (`reference/bazel/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/skyframe/`).
 *
 * The harness builds one `Consensus` per case over a migrated in-memory
 * database, with the journal fencing through that same instance, so the
 * fencing cases exercise the strategy exactly as `emitDurable`, `checkpoint`,
 * and `compact` do.
