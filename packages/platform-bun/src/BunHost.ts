/**
 * Aggregate Bun Host bundle.
 *
 * Runtime-specific dependencies stay inside this package; callers get the same
 * closed five-service Host surface every other bundle provides.
 *
 * There is no Bun shell module: running a command is Effect's
 * `ChildProcessSpawner`, and `@effect/platform-bun`'s implementation is
 * `@effect/platform-node-shared`'s re-exported — the same code on both
 * runtimes, so no runtime detection is needed here.
 *
 * There is no Bun HTTP module either: outgoing requests are Effect's
 * `HttpClient`, and `@effect/platform-bun/BunHttpClient` is Effect's own
 * fetch-backed implementation. Bun reaches for it directly rather than
 * borrowing a browser package to get at `fetch`. The one thing configured here
 * is `redirect: "manual"`, so the runtime never walks to a second origin
 * behind the capability kernel's back; following a redirect is
 * `@smthrs/kernel`'s guarded `HttpClient.layer`, which rechecks every hop.
