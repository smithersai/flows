/**
 * The seat: what a flow or an action declares to pick the model it runs on.
 *
 * A seat has two halves and they live in different places on purpose.
 *
 * The declared half is an ordinary string, and this module deliberately ships
 * no schema for it. It is what a markdown flow's `model:` frontmatter carries
 * and what {@link module:AgentAction}'s `seat` option takes, and it carries no
 * credentials, no endpoint, and no client: a declaration is portable, and a run
 * that reads one out of a repository must not be handed the keys with it. The
 * convention the Node CLI resolver understands is `provider:modelId`
 * (`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5`), with the provider ahead of the separator and
 * the model id after it. That convention belongs to the resolver, not to the
 * agent. A host that installs its own {@link module:SeatResolver} may accept
 * anything it likes, including a bare model id or a logical name like `fast` or
 * `reviewer`, because nothing below the resolver parses the string.
 *
 * The resolved half is {@link Seat}, which is what the agent actually runs on:
 * a live {@link Model.Model}, the {@link FlowEngineLike.RouteResolver} that
 * seals its requests, and the model's context window in tokens so compaction
 * has a real budget. Only a `SeatResolver` produces one, and a seat it cannot
 * turn into a route is a typed {@link SeatUnresolved} rather than a run that
 * fails halfway through.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
