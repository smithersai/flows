/**
 * The one door into time travel: inspect, fork, rewind.
 *
 * `Replay`, `Fork`, `Rewind`, `Retry`, `Recovery`, `Compensation`, and the
 * effect-handler registry are machinery under `src/internal/`; a caller never
 * names them. This service fronts the three verbs of
 * `docs/specs/Concepts/Time Travel.md` and owns the wiring they used to make
 * the caller thread: the ownership claim a rewind rides, the jj workspace a
 * fork lands in, the compensation-handler registry, and startup recovery of an
 * interrupted rewind.
 *
 * Recovery is not an operation. {@link layer} finishes or rolls back every
 * pending rewind audit while it is being built, so the service only ever hands
 * out a store whose interrupted work is already resolved.
 *
 * The tag key `@smthrs/time-travel/TimeTravel` is durable identity: step keys
 * digest the resolved service set, so renaming it invalidates recorded runs.
 *
