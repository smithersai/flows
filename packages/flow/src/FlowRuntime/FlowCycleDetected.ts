/**
 * Raised when executing a flow would close a cycle in the persisted
 * parent-execution chain — a child asking to execute an execution id that
 * already appears among its own ancestors.
 *
 * This is a **typed failure**, never a defect: the caller is expected to be
 * able to recover from it (see `docs/specs/Concepts/Run Ownership.md` and
 * `docs/architecture/implementation-status.md`). Detection itself lives in
 * `@smthrs/engine-store`'s `DurableEngineState.recordRunParent`, which
 * inserts the durable parent edge and walks the parent chain in O(depth)
 * inside one storage transaction, rolling back on a hit; the error is
 * declared here because it is part of the `execute` contract this package
 * owns.
