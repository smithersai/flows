/**
 * Graph building: a flow declaration plus a real payload, walked once into the
 * drafts a plan is compiled from.
 *
 * This is the plan phase of `docs/specs/Concepts/Build Phases.md` and nothing
 * else — no I/O, no execution, no elaboration. {@link build} evaluates the
 * body with the REAL payload, because a body's own payload is data
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Unified Flow Authoring.md`), and evaluates every
 * continuation and branch arm exactly once against a STRICT
 * {@link module:Planned.Planned} placeholder, because a step result does not
 * exist yet. A body that computes on a placeholder therefore fails here,
 * naming the node, rather than baking `NaN` into a plan.
 *
 * Fatal refusals stay fatal. Computing on a planned value throws its
 * `GraphBuildError` immediately, as does recursively expanding an inline
 * `.call()`, because either case makes the requested graph invalid. Recoverable
 * topology loss, such as a missing or invalid continuation, is reported in
 * {@link Graph.diagnostics} so the remaining graph can still be inspected.
 *
 * The walk is stack-safe by construction: topology and payloads are traversed
 * with explicit stacks, never native recursion, and each carries a nesting
 * bound. Topology past the bound is a typed `graph_too_deep` refusal, a
 * payload past it is `payload_too_deep`, and a payload containing itself is
 * `cyclic_payload` — all three fail loudly where unbounded recursion would
 * overflow the native stack without a typed error.
 *
 * Composition follows the same note: `Other.call(payload)` splices the
 * callee's body into this graph with the capabilities of the two declarations
 * intersected, and a flow that calls itself inline throws with the trampoline
 * (`docs/specs/Concepts/Trampoline Loops.md`) and the child boundary as the two
 * ways out. A callee whose declared placement the enclosing flow does not carry
 * throws for the same reason and names the same way out, because inline
 * expansion is the claim that these steps run in the caller's execution.
 * `Other.child(payload)` is that boundary: one leaf node here, its own
 * execution when the graph is driven. A branch expands BOTH arms, so the
 * exit condition and the handoff site are visible topology before anything
 * runs, and the predicate rides the branch's key material as a digest.
 *
 * What comes out is `@smthrs/plan` shaped: {@link Graph.drafts} feeds
 * `Plan.compile` and `Plan.append` unchanged, and the `Ref`/`Pending` inputs a
 * node's key material names are what the compiler turns into dependency
 * digests and the plan turns into edges. Structural node ids are derived only
 * from traversal positions and do not enter a plan draft's hashed value, so
 * editing a mapper re-keys exactly what reads it. The interpreter does use an
 * `ActionCall` id as durable dispatch-site material: it is the replay-stable
 * discriminator that keeps identical declarations at distinct graph
 * positions out of one arrival-ordered ordinal scope.
 *
 * Adapted from the agent repo's `@smthrs/core` `Graph.ts`. The lenient
 * placeholder, the model-shaped `Dynamic` node, the lane-merge elaboration,
 * and the conflict pass do not come across: the placeholder is strict here,
 * a model call is an ordinary action, and write overlap is resolved by
 * `Plan.compile`, which owns that verdict.
