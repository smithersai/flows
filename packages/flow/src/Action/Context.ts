/**
 * The ordinal slots a retry sequence shares across its attempts, keyed by
 * allocation scope.
 *
 * `Action.retry` cannot allocate ordinals itself — allocation is scoped by
 * action identity and only the engine knows which action is being
 * dispatched (issue #73) — so it provides an empty map the engine fills per
 * scope on the first attempt and reads back on every later one. The map is
 * scope-keyed rather than a single value because one retry block may
 * dispatch several distinct actions; a shared unkeyed slot handed the
 * first action's ordinal to every later one, silently skipping their own
 * name-scoped counters and aliasing a later independent dispatch onto an
 * in-block key (issue #84).
 *
 * Each scope pins a *sequence* of ordinals rather than a single value
 * (issue #100): one retry block may dispatch the same declaration several
 * times, and a single-valued slot handed the first dispatch's ordinal to
 * every later one, so the second dispatch silently replayed the first's
 * recorded outcome. `cursors` counts the dispatches of each scope within the
 * current attempt — `Action.retry` resets it at every attempt boundary —
 * so the n-th same-scope dispatch of every attempt reuses the n-th pinned
 * ordinal.

/**
 * Context reference carrying the persisted key of the dispatch an
 * implementation is currently running under, when the runtime supplies one.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use it in an action implementation that has to name durable state of its
 * own — `Sleep` names a `DurableClock` — so the name it derives belongs to
 * THIS dispatch. The key is the identity the engine already allocated for the
 * dispatch: its attempt rows, its recorded outcome, and its cache row are
 * addressed by it, so it is stable across every replay of one node and
 * distinct between two identical calls of the same declaration. Deriving from
 * it is therefore the only way an implementation gets both properties without
 * allocating a second identity beside the engine's.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * A runtime that has not adopted the seam leaves the reference absent rather
 * than substituting a placeholder, because a placeholder would silently alias
 * every dispatch of one declaration onto one name. An implementation that
 * needs durable identity refuses instead.
