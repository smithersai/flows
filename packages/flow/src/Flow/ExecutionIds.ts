/**
 * The ambient source of execution identity, for a flow executed without one.
 *
 * Identity has three sources, in this order: the `executionId` the caller
 * named, the `idempotencyKey` the flow declared, and — when neither exists —
 * the source in this module. The first two are decisions an author made at the
 * call site or the declaration site; the third is a decision the *host* makes
 * once, for every flow it drives, which is why it is a context reference and
 * not another option on `execute`.
 *
 * The default derives the id from the flow tag and the payload's canonical
 * form, so `yield* Flow.execute(payload)` runs without ceremony and re-running
 * the same invocation lands on the same execution. A host for which two equal
 * payloads are two unrelated pieces of work — a coding agent running one
 * request per user is the case `packages/engine/VENDOR.md` names — installs its
 * own source with {@link layerExecutionIds} and scopes identity to whatever
 * makes runs related there.
