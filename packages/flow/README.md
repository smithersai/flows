# @smthrs/flow

The flow authoring model. It defines typed flows, actions, durable waits
and queues, retry policy, step identity, and the runtime port those APIs are
executed against. `@smthrs/engine` implements that port; `@smthrs/engine-store`
makes it durable.

```sh
pnpm add @smthrs/flow
```

## Mental model

A `Flow` is the durable program, `Action` values are its recorded
operations, and a `FlowRuntime` runs them. The remaining primitives let the
program wait without requiring the process to stay alive.

```text
Flow
 ├─ executes Action values
 ├─ waits on DurableDeferred values
 ├─ sleeps with DurableClock
 └─ delegates work through DurableQueue
             │
             ▼
        FlowRuntime  (the port)
   records, suspends, and resumes
             ▲
             │
   @smthrs/engine  (the implementation)
```

| Source               | Role                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Flow/`              | Defines a complete durable program and its execute, poll, interrupt, resume, and rollback lifecycle.                      |
| `Action/`            | Defines an individual durable operation whose result a runtime records or replays, plus its step identity and boundaries. |
| `FlowRuntime/`       | The execution contract those APIs require, the per-execution state contract, and the cycle failure `execute` can return.  |
| `DurableDeferred.ts` | A persisted promise that a flow can await across process restarts.                                                        |
| `DurableClock.ts`    | A timer that eventually completes a `DurableDeferred`.                                                                    |
| `DurableQueue.ts`    | Sends work to a persisted worker and awaits its result through a `DurableDeferred`.                                       |
| `RetryPolicy.ts`     | Data describing when a runtime should retry a failed action.                                                              |
| `index.ts`           | Exposes the public namespaces.                                                                                            |

## Usage

An `Action` carries an implementation, attached separately as a layer. A
`Flow` carries a `body`, and never opaque code.

```ts
import { Action, Flow, Interpreter } from "@smthrs/flow"
import { Effect, Layer, Schema } from "effect"

const Render = Action.make("render", {
  payload: { name: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String
})

const Greet = Flow.make("Greet", {
  payload: { name: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  idempotencyKey: ({ name }) => name,
  body: (payload) => Render.call(payload)
})

const GreetLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
  Render.toLayer(({ name }) => Effect.succeed(`hello ${name}`)),
  Interpreter.layer(Greet)
).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations))
```

Provide a runtime — `FlowEngine.layerMemory` from `@smthrs/engine` in tests, or
the durable engine from `@smthrs/engine-store` in production — and execute the
flow.

### Planning is requirement-free; executing is not

`Render.call(payload)` records a node and runs nothing, so building the plan a
body describes asks for no service. What it does do is put a requirement in the
node's type — one minted by `Action.make` and keyed by the action tag — and
`Flow.make` reads the union of those off the node its body returns:

```ts
Greet.execute({ name: "Ada" }, { executionId: "greet-ada" })
// Effect<string, never, FlowRuntime | Action.Requirement<"render">>
```

`Render.toLayer(...)` provides that requirement, so the composition above erases
it and the wrong composition does not compile. **Forgetting an implementation is
an error at the call site rather than a run that dies partway through.** Three
rules follow from where a plan actually goes:

- `.call()` propagates the channel: an inline callee's steps join the caller's
  plan, so its obligations are the caller's.
- `.child()` and `.to()` drop it. Each opens a new execution whose driver
  provides its own context, and dropping it at `.to()` is also what keeps a
  self-looping lineage's type finite.
- `.poll()`, `.interrupt()`, and `.resume()` do not collect it. The first two
  never drive a body, and a re-drive runs under the context the flow was
  REGISTERED with, not the resumer's.

`Sleep` and `WaitFor` are declared with `Action.makeSystem` and mint no
requirement: the engine implements them, so an author cannot be the one who
forgot them.

The name-keyed `Action.Implementations` table is unchanged and is still how a
run resolves an action, because a driver expanding a plan read back out of a
journal has no types left to consult. `toLayer` does both — provides the tag,
and files into the table when a composition wired one up.

## Dependency direction

`@smthrs/flow` depends on no package that executes flows. `FlowRuntime` is the
seam: authoring APIs are written against the port, and an engine supplies it.
There is deliberately no dependency, type-only or otherwise, from this package
back to `@smthrs/engine`.

## Public API

The root exports these namespaces, also available from matching
`@smthrs/flow/*` subpaths.

| Namespace         | Public exports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

// Flow.make: payload fields (or a struct schema), success/error schemas, the
// required pure body, and an optional idempotencyKey for deterministic
// execution IDs.
const Review = Flow.make("Review", {
  payload: { pr: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  error: ReviewFailed,
  idempotencyKey: ({ pr }) => pr,
  body: (payload) => Verdict.call(payload)
})

// Flow annotations: capture defects in results, or park instead of failing.
const Hardened = Review
  .annotate(Flow.CaptureDefects, true)
  .annotate(Flow.SuspendOnFailure, true)

// Interpreter.layer drives the body; the action implementations the body
// names attach beside it, over the table they file themselves in.
const ReviewHandler = Layer.mergeAll(
  Verdict.toLayer(({ pr }) => Effect.succeed(`lgtm ${pr}`)),
  Interpreter.layer(Review)
).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations))

// Run and observe. execute needs an executionId unless the flow declares
// idempotencyKey (Review does, so it may be omitted); discard: true
// returns the execution ID without waiting.
const run = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const executionId = yield* Review.executionId({ pr: "42" })
  const started = yield* Review.execute({ pr: "42" }, { discard: true })
  const result = yield* Review.poll(executionId) // Option<Flow.Result<string, ReviewFailed>>
  if (Option.isSome(result) && Flow.isResult(result.value)) {
    result.value._tag // "Complete" (Flow.Complete) | "Suspended" (Flow.Suspended)
  }
  yield* Review.interrupt(executionId)
  yield* Review.resume(executionId)
  return started
}).pipe(
  Effect.provide(ReviewHandler),
  Effect.provide(FlowEngine.layerMemory)
)
```

Inside a handler, `Flow.scope` / `Flow.provideScope` / `Flow.addFinalizer`
manage the execution-scoped resource scope, `Flow.suspend(instance)` parks
the execution, `Flow.withRollback(effect, rollback)` registers how to undo a
successful effect if the enclosing flow later fails, and `Flow.intoResult` /
`Flow.wrapActionResult` convert
handler effects to `Flow.Result` values (serialized via `Flow.Result`,
`Flow.ResultEncoded`, `Flow.Complete.Schema`, and `Flow.Suspended`).
Executing without an execution ID or idempotency key fails with
`Flow.ExecutionIdRequired`.

Registering a behavior under a flow tag is the runtime's own seam and stays
internal to this package: a flow has one behavior and it is the body, so there
is no `toLayer` on a flow to attach a second one with.

### Action — durable steps, tiers, retries, races

```ts
import { Action, RetryPolicy } from "@smthrs/flow"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"

// Tiers: "sealed" (default), "compensable" (requires a
// FlowEngine.SnapshotBoundary in context), "irreversible" (retry requires
// an idempotencyKey, else IrreversibleRetryRequiresIdempotencyKey).
const charge = Action.make({
  name: "charge",
  success: Schema.String,
  error: Schema.String,
  tier: "irreversible",
  idempotencyKey: "charge:pr-42", // string | object
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy.defaultRetryPolicy,
  execute: Effect.gen(function*() {
    const attempt = yield* Action.CurrentAttempt // 1-based retry attempt
    const ordinal = yield* Action.CurrentOrdinal // run-local step ordinal
    // Action.idempotencyKey derives a run-local invocation key effectfully:
    const key = yield* Action.idempotencyKey("charge", { includeAttempt: true })
    return `charged on attempt ${attempt} (step ${ordinal}, key ${key})`
  })
})

// Action.retry wraps an action with Effect.retry semantics while
// threading CurrentAttempt/CurrentOrdinal; Action.raceAll races several
// actions durably. Infrastructure interrupts surface as
// Action.InfraInterrupt and honor `interruptRetryPolicy`.
const resilient = Action.retry(charge, { times: 3 })
const fastest = Action.raceAll("fastest-charge", [charge, resilient])
```

### DurableClock — durable sleep

```ts
import { DurableClock } from "@smthrs/flow"

// Short sleeps run in memory; anything past inMemoryThreshold (default
// 60s) schedules a durable clock and suspends the flow.
const wait = DurableClock.sleep({
  name: "cooldown",
  duration: "2 days",
  inMemoryThreshold: "30 seconds"
})

// DurableClock.make builds the clock value directly.
const clock = DurableClock.make({ name: "cooldown", duration: "2 days" })
```

### DurableDeferred — external completion

```ts
import { DurableDeferred } from "@smthrs/flow"
import { Effect, Exit, Schema } from "effect"

const Approval = DurableDeferred.make("Approval", {
  success: Schema.Boolean,
  error: Schema.String
})

// Inside the flow: await the deferred (suspends until completed), or run
// an effect "into" it so its exit completes the deferred durably.
const awaitApproval = DurableDeferred.await(Approval)
const computed = DurableDeferred.into(Effect.succeed(true), Approval)
// raceAll races effects durably, persisting the first exit:
const winner = DurableDeferred.raceAll({
  name: "first-answer",
  success: Schema.Boolean,
  error: Schema.String,
  effects: [awaitApproval, computed]
})

// Tokens identify a deferred from outside the flow. Inside a flow:
const tokenInFlow = DurableDeferred.token(Approval)
// Outside, derive it from the flow + executionId or payload:
declare const Review: import("@smthrs/engine").Flow.Any
const token = DurableDeferred.tokenFromExecutionId(Approval, {
  flow: Review,
  executionId: "run-17"
})
const tokenFromPayload = DurableDeferred.tokenFromPayload(Approval, {
  flow: Review,
  payload: { pr: "42" }
})
// Tokens round-trip through DurableDeferred.Token /
// DurableDeferred.TokenParsed (fromString / FromString / encode / asToken).

// External completion resumes the suspended flow:
const approve = DurableDeferred.succeed(Approval, { token, value: true })
const reject = DurableDeferred.fail(Approval, { token, error: "denied" })
const settle = DurableDeferred.done(Approval, { token, exit: Exit.succeed(true) })
// DurableDeferred.failCause completes with a full Cause.
```

### DurableQueue — durable work queues

```ts
import { DurableQueue } from "@smthrs/flow"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"

const Renders = DurableQueue.make({
  name: "Renders",
  payload: { page: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  idempotencyKey: ({ page }) => page
})

// Flow side: enqueue and durably wait for a worker's answer.
const rendered = DurableQueue.process(Renders, { page: "home" })

// Worker side: DurableQueue.worker returns a Layer (forked, scoped);
// DurableQueue.makeWorker is the underlying worker effect.
const RendersWorker = DurableQueue.worker(
  Renders,
  ({ page }) => Effect.succeed(`<html>${page}</html>`),
  { concurrency: 4 }
)
```

### RetryPolicy — declarative retry decisions

```ts
import { RetryPolicy } from "@smthrs/flow"

const policy = RetryPolicy.make({
  initialMs: 100,
  factor: 2,
  maxMs: 10_000,
  maxAttempts: 5,
  jitterRatio: 0.2,
  nonRetryable: ["ReviewFailed"]
})
// RetryPolicy.defaultRetryPolicy: 200ms initial, 1.5x factor, 30s cap.

// Pure decision helpers:
const decision = RetryPolicy.decide(policy, { attempt: 2, error: new Error("x") })
// RetryDecision = RetryAfter | GiveUp; built with retryAfter(ms) / giveUp(reason)
const delay = RetryPolicy.nextDelay(policy, 2) // Option<number>; None = give up
RetryPolicy.errorTag(new Error("x")) // extract an error's tag
RetryPolicy.isNonRetryable(policy, new Error("x"))
// RetryPolicy.decideEffect is the effectful variant; exhausting attempts
// yields RetryPolicy.RetryAttemptsExhausted.
```
