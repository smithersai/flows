# Retell main as the documented clean series

Perform the first full retell described in
`docs/specs/Concepts/Clean History.md`: rebuild `main` from an empty root as
an ordered series of clean commits that documents the implementation of the
entire repo ahead of the code.

- Series order: the spec vault first, then per package a docs commit
  (README + JSDoc, per `docs/specs/Concepts/Colocated Docs.md`) followed by
  that package's implementation commits, then the tests that pin behavior.
- Every narrative commit description carries trailers naming the `vibe`
  change-ids it was folded from.
- End state must pass the tree-equality gate: `jj diff --from main --to vibe`
  is empty.
- `vibe` is untouched; it keeps the real history.
- Do not start until item 0002's parity gate exists, so the docs commits in
  the series are gated, not aspirational.
