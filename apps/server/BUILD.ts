/**
 * Targets for the Worker application: the typecheck and the unit suite.
 *
 * `pnpm run check` and `pnpm test` used to reach this package only through the
 * recursive root scripts, which the target graph cannot plan. These targets are
 * the same gates as declarations, so the pipeline runs them by label and a red
 * suite re-keys on the sources it reads.
 *
 * The suite runs under Bun, which is what the app's own scripts use, so the
 * runtime is the root Bun declaration and nothing here spells `bun` into an
 * argv.
