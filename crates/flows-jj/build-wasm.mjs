/**
 * Builds `flows_jj.wasm` — the wasm32-wasip1 reactor module behind
 * `BrowserJj` — and copies it to `packages/jj/wasm/flows_jj.wasm`.
 *
 * The Rust side lives in this crate (`crates/flows-jj`), which depends on the
 * patched jj fork at `vendor/jj`. The build runs through the repo-root Cargo
 * workspace so native tests and the wasm artifact share one lockfile, and it
 * builds `--locked` so the artifact always reflects the committed Cargo.lock.
 *
 * The committed artifact is a reproducibility contract: CI rebuilds it with
 * the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and fails on any byte drift.
 * rustc embeds source paths in panic locations, so the build remaps every
 * machine-specific prefix — the repository checkout, `CARGO_HOME`, and the
 * toolchain sysroot — to fixed tokens. Without the remapping, the same
 * commit produces different bytes on every machine and checkout path.
 *
 * The contract is scoped to one host triple, because no flag remaps the host.
 * Cargo compiles build scripts for the host, so the `-C metadata` hash of
 * every crate that has one — and of everything above it, which here reaches
 * jj-lib and flows-jj — carries the host triple. rustc folds `-C metadata`
 * into the crate's `StableCrateId`, which seeds every symbol hash, and it
 * orders codegen items by symbol name, so a different host reorders the
 * module and LLVM then optimizes it differently. Measured on 1.89.0 from
 * identical sources: aarch64-apple-darwin, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, and
 * aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu each produce a different artifact, differing in
 * function count and code size, not just in symbol names. The committed
 * bytes therefore belong to the declared host below — the one CI runs — and
 * this script refuses to build them anywhere else rather than write bytes CI
 * cannot match.
 *
 * Honors `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; a relative value resolves against the workspace
 * root, exactly as cargo resolves it for the build itself. It needs no token
 * of its own: an out-of-tree target directory builds the same bytes as the
 * in-tree default, verified on the canonical host and on macOS.
 *
 * `--verify` rebuilds without writing and compares the result against the
 * committed artifact, which is the reproducibility gate itself. Without it the
 * gate was three shell steps — copy the committed bytes aside, rebuild over
 * them, `cmp` — that only a workflow file could sequence.
 *
 * Run it from anywhere: `node crates/flows-jj/build-wasm.mjs`.
 * Prerequisite: rustup — `rust-toolchain.toml` supplies the toolchain,
 * the `wasm32-wasip1` target, and the components. Off the canonical host,
 * run it in a container; `foreignHostError` prints the command.
