/**
 * Targets for the `flows-jj` crate and the WebAssembly artifact it produces.
 *
 * The Rust gates and the wasm reproducibility gate are declared here, beside the
 * crate that owns them, so `smthrs lint '//crates/flows-jj:cargoClippy'` is the
 * same command a pipeline runs. The cargo flags that make a check a gate live in
 * the target implementations, not here.
 *
 * The two lanes are addressed by exact label rather than by a recursive pattern
 * on purpose. The cargo gates need only a Rust toolchain; the wasm rebuild needs
 * an uncached one and takes minutes, so it is a separate CI job and a bare
 * `//crates/flows-jj` under the test verb would pull it into both.
