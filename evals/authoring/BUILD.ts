 * side effects with no file output, so they are `ToolRun` targets: never cached,
 * gated to the `run` verb, and never pulled into a `ci` graph. Each reads its
 * credential from the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` secret, never from a literal, so no

 *
 *   pnpm exec smthrs run '//evals/authoring:sftLaunch'
