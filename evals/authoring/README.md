# Authoring fine-tune

Assets and build targets for the Smithers workflow-authoring fine-tune on
Fireworks (Kimi K3). This directory holds the supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
dataset and declares the operations that validate, upload, and train on it as
first-class build-system targets, so none of them is a copy-paste shell command.

## Layout

| Path                    | What it is                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `data/pilot-sft.jsonl`  | The pilot SFT dataset: 10 OpenAI chat-format rows.                  |
| `validate.ts`           | Dataset validator. Exit code is the verdict; no external deps.      |
| `BUILD.ts`              | The targets below.                                                  |

## Targets

Deterministic, cache-eligible, and part of `ci`:

- `//evals/authoring:datasetValidate` — proves every dataset row is a
  well-formed chat example. Run it with `pnpm exec smthrs test
  '//evals/authoring:datasetValidate'`.
- `//evals/authoring:types` — typechecks the validator.

Irreversible Fireworks operations. Each is a
[`ToolRun`](../../packages/build/docs/reference/targets/tool-run.md): never
cached, gated to the `run` verb so it can never enter a `ci` graph, and backed
by the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` secret rather than a literal credential.

- `//evals/authoring:datasetUpload` — `firectl dataset create`. Depends on
  `datasetValidate`, so a malformed dataset never reaches the account. Uploading
  a name that already exists fails, by design.
- `//evals/authoring:sftLaunch` — `firectl supervised-fine-tuning-job create`
  on `kimi-k3`. Every run starts a new billed job.

Run one explicitly, for example:

```
pnpm exec smthrs run '//evals/authoring:sftLaunch'
```

## Prerequisites for the operations

The `firectl` CLI must be installed and signed in (`firectl signin`), and
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. `firectl` refuses mutating
commands when it detects it is running inside an AI agent, so run the operation
targets from a human shell.

## Not yet here

The offline authoring benchmark harness (deterministic graders plus the
live-model runner) still lives at
`~/Desktop/fireworks-smithers-finetune/work/benchmark/harness`. It imports
`zod` and `typescript`, so wiring its suite as a `ci` target requires making
this directory a workspace package (a generated `pnpm-workspace.yaml` change and
an install), which is the follow-up to bring the benchmark under the graph.
