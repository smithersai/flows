/**
 * Targets for the SWE-bench benchmark rig.
 *
 * One target only: the typecheck of the rig's own TypeScript. The benchmark
 * itself is deliberately not a target. It spends real API tokens, needs docker
 * and multi-gigabyte images, and takes tens of minutes per instance, so it is
 * operator-run — a gate that cannot run without a funded key and a warm docker
 * cache is not a gate. `verify.sh` is the offline check that the scorecard
 * still computes what it claims, and it is run by hand for the same reason:
 * it exists to defend an operator workflow, not to hold the tree.
