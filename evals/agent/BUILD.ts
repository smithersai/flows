/**
 * Targets for the offline agent evaluation suite.
 *
 * The suite is a program whose exit code is the verdict — it scores the agent
 * against `baseline.json` and fails on drift — so it is a test target, and its
 * own typecheck is a build target. Both run through the declared toolchain:
 * the suite under the declared Bun runtime, the typecheck through the declared
 * package manager, so neither `bun` nor `npx` is spelled anywhere.
