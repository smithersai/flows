# `@smthrs/time-travel`

This page is the public API reference for the `TimeTravel` service and the stores it reads through. The service is not part of every engine composition, but its evidence is: an ordinary `EngineStore` run stamps `meta.lineageId` on every record, journals a tier-2 anchor per attempt, and writes effect-boundary records, so a journal is inspectable, forkable, and rewindable without the application emitting anything by hand.

## Frames and stores

`Frame.Frame` is the schema for `{ lineageId, seq }`. `LineageEdgeKind` is `child`, `fork`, or `continuation`; `LineageEdge` relates a parent sequence to a child run. Store snapshots associate that frame with a run ID and Jujutsu change ID.

`TimeTravelStore.Service` stores and retrieves:

- snapshots at frames — `snapshotAt` reads the nearest anchor at or before a frame, `recordSnapshot` writes one (the snapshot projector is its only caller),
- run state and admitted attempts at a frame — `stateAt` and `attemptsAt` fold the journal's own decision and attempt records rather than reading the run row's current values,
- descendants and lineage edges,
- rewind audits and compensation receipts,
- fork records,
- atomic archive/truncation results.

`TimeTravelStore` exports `make`, `makeNoop`, and `layerNoop`. `MemoryTimeTravelStore.make/layer` provides observable memory state. `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate`, `make`, and `layer` provide SQL persistence over `DurableWriter` and Effect's `SqlClient`.

## Operations

`TimeTravel` is one injectable service with three operations, each addressed by
a `Position` — a run ID plus a `Frame`:

| Operation | Main API |
| --- | --- |
| inspect | `inspect(position, projection)` folds committed journal entries |
| fork | `fork(position, options?)` creates a fork and its derived Jujutsu workspace |
| rewind | `rewind(position, options?)` runs the fenced audit/compensate/restore/archive protocol |

`TimeTravel.layer` requires `TimeTravelStore`, `Journal`, `RunStore`,
`CacheStore`, and `Jj`, and nothing else. Building it completes or rolls back
interrupted rewind audits, so recovery is never a call. `Replay`, `Fork`,
`Rewind`, `Retry`, `Recovery`, `Compensation`, and `EffectHandlerRegistry` are
internal machinery under `src/internal/`.

`ForkOptions` carries only `workspaceRoot`; the workspace name and path are
derived from the position. `RewindOptions` carries `detachedChildren` and
`pageSize`; the owner and audit ID are minted internally. `RewindResult`
returns audit, archive, assessments, warnings, and cancelled children.

Cancelling a detached child under `detachedChildren: "cancel"` is terminal and happens *before* the archive commit point, so it is the one rewind mutation rollback cannot undo. Each cancellation is written to the audit detail as it happens, and a rewind that later rolls back keeps the full `cancelledChildren` list and names the surviving cancellations in `detail.failure`. A `rolled_back` audit therefore never understates what the attempt left behind.

Startup recovery uses archive evidence, not the engine-store replay classifier. An audit at `archive_committed` or `completed` is completed. Otherwise recovery requires the recorded suffix tail to be absent from the live journal and present in the archive. Missing or partial suffix evidence, or missing archive evidence, rolls back the compensation and restores the run's original state; it does not declare the rewind complete.

## External-effect records

`EffectBoundary.guard` records an external effect’s intended and terminal status using the journal. `fromEntry` and `fromEntries` decode those records. `eventType` is the stable journal event name.

The engine writes these records itself: an irreversible action dispatch is
wrapped in an `intended` record before the body runs and a `succeeded` or
`unknown` record after it settles, and a child spawn is journaled as one too.

Compensation planning stays internal — `rewind` resolves handlers, classifies
each record as `revertible`, `warning`, or `blocking`, and records the rollback
receipts on its audit itself. What is public is the *door*:
`CompensationHandlers.layer([...])` contributes handlers from the composition
that owns the adapter. It is optional; with none provided, a crossed record that
is not sealed resolves to no handler, classifies as `blocking`, and the rewind
fails with `irreversible`.

| Export | Kind | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CompensationHandlers` | service | the handlers a composition contributes |
| `layer(handlers)`, `layerNoop` | layers | provide them; `layerNoop` is the default |
| `Handler` | shape | `kind`, `tier`, `residue`, `revert`, optional `assess`/`rollback` |

## Errors

`TimeTravelError` is the tagged failure type. `TimeTravelErrorCode` is `busy`, `live_parent`, `live_child`, `not_found`, `rate_limited`, `compensation_failed`, `irreversible`, or `unknown`. `error(code, message, cause?)` is the constructor helper.

## Fork

`SqlTimeTravelStore.createFork` creates a restartable engine row whose state is
the state **at** the frame — folded from the run-decision records, not copied
from the parent's current row — copies the selected journal prefix, copies only
the attempts that prefix can explain, and writes a `fork-created` marker on the
child naming `(parentRunId, forkJournalOffset)`. Lineage is recorded twice: in
`flows_time_travel_edges` for the attach/detach protocol, and in the child's
`flows_runs.parent_run_id` so ancestry is walkable with a recursive CTE and
survives edge archival. Child-spawn edges are not stored a third time; they are
derived from the parent journal's own spawn record, the only source that carries
a parent sequence.

A fork never touches the parent: the boundary assessment still runs, but every
verdict is normalized into `Fork.warnings` — "this effect may execute again on
the child" — and nothing is reverted, truncated, or restored. The child's lane is
added but **not** pinned to the frame's jj pointer: `Jj` acts on the one working
copy it is rooted at and cannot provision a workspace at a revision, so pinning
it would restore the parent's tree. The fork discloses the pointer as a warning
instead (`.smithers/tickets/fork-workspace-revision.md`).
