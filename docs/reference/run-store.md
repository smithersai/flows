# `@smthrs/run-store`

This page is the public API reference for **executable run state**: run rows,
action attempt rows, and the ownership arbitration that fences them. It was
split out of `@smthrs/journal` — see
[`docs/specs/Concepts/Journal Split.md`](../../../docs/specs/Concepts/Journal%20Split.md).

Recovery reads these stores. The journal is history, audit, replay evidence,
and the sync feed; this package is what a restart rebuilds from.
`Journal.transact` keeps the two halves consistent, because both write through
the same `DurableWriter` and so commit as one transaction.

## RunStore

`RunStore` exports:

- `RunStatus`: `pending`, `running`, `suspended`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
- `RunRow`, `RunSnapshot`, `CreateOptions`, and `TransitionGuard`.
- fenced `create`, `get`, `claim`, `claimAndOwn`, `activate`, `abandonClaim`, `recoverClaim`, `heartbeat`, `transitionOwned`, and `steal`, plus unfenced `requestCancel`.
- tagged outcome unions for every compare-and-set operation.
- `make`, `layer`, `makeNoop`, and `layerNoop`.

### Run metadata: columns versus `state_json`

`flows_runs` carries exactly two metadata columns beyond identity, lifecycle, and ownership:

| Column | Why it is a column |
| --- | --- |
| `cancel_requested_at_ms` | It participates in a compare-and-swap. `transitionOwned(..., { cancelRequested: "absent" })` compiles the predicate into the same `UPDATE` as the ownership fence, so a cancellation request cannot slip between a read and a terminal write. |
| `parent_run_id` | Lineage is walked in SQL. A recursive CTE over `parent_run_id` answers ancestry questions that a JSON side-channel would force into decode-then-filter. |

Everything else a harness records about a run — flow name and hash, cancel attribution, pause and hijack requests, VCS coordinates, config — stays in `state_json`. That is the intended extension point, not a workaround: those fields are read with the row, never guarded on, and adding a column per harness concept would make the schema a union of its consumers. `state_json` is checked to be valid JSON, and `transitionOwned` replaces it atomically with the status change.

When a `state_json` field does need to be scanned, index the expression rather than promoting the column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX flows_runs_flow_name_idx
ON flows_runs (json_extract(state_json, '$.flowName'));

SELECT run_id FROM flows_runs
WHERE json_extract(state_json, '$.flowName') = 'deploy';
```

Promote a field to a column only when it must appear in a CAS guard. `TransitionGuard` is the seam for that: new guarded metadata extends the interface and the single `UPDATE`, rather than adding a transition variant per rule.

`requestCancel(runId, nowMs)` records the request without an owner fence — any observer may ask, and the owner decides at its next guarded transition. It returns `CancelRequested`, `AlreadyRequested` (with the original request time, which is never overwritten), or `NotFound`. A guarded transition that loses only to its guard returns `GuardFailed`, distinct from `FenceLost`.

`Ownership.OwnerId` contains `hostId`, `pid`, and `nonce`. `LivenessEvidence` records observer and observation time. `heartbeatLoop`, `heartbeatInterval`, `heartbeatStaleAfter`, `heartbeatSkewAllowance`, and `heartbeatWriteTolerance` support scoped ownership maintenance. The loop interrupts its owner immediately on durable evidence that the fence is gone (any outcome other than `Updated`), but tolerates failed heartbeat *writes* for `heartbeatWriteTolerance`. That budget is `heartbeatStaleAfter` minus `heartbeatSkewAllowance` minus one heartbeat tick. The allowance is explicit because the owner stamps the heartbeat from its own clock while the stealer judges it against *its* clock, so the hosts' offset is subtracted straight from the owner's margin; the tick covers the budget only being re-evaluated once per pulse. Within the allowance the owner always stops executing side effects before a steal can be admitted. Beyond it the lease is bounded, not guaranteed: durable writes stay safe because the ownership compare-and-set fences them, but non-durable external side effects can overlap — inherent to any wall-clock lease, and a caller that cannot tolerate overlap needs a fencing token at the side effect itself. A successful pulse re-arms that window.

## AttemptStore

`AttemptStore` addresses rows with `AttemptId`, exposes `put`, `get`, `heartbeat`, `finish`, and `patch`, and returns explicit fenced outcome unions.

`make`/`layer` use the default policy; `makeWith(options)`/`layerWith(options)` take an `Options`:

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inProgressStates` | `["running"]` | States the store treats as still in progress. `heartbeat` and `finish` fence on membership, and `finish` refuses them as targets. A harness whose vocabulary is `in-progress` configures it here instead of translating at the boundary. |
| `maxCheckpointBytes` | `1048576` | Largest encoded checkpoint accepted. Raise it when the durable mid-attempt checkpoint is an agent session rather than a cursor. |
| `putMode` | `"insert"` | `"insert"` is first-writer-wins: a re-put with different content reports `Conflict`. `"upsert"` overwrites the row and reports `Upserted`. Both keep the run-ownership fence. |

`finish` COALESCEs `error_json`, `outcome_json`, and `meta_json`: a value recorded mid-flight by `put` or `patch` survives a terminal claim that omits it, and supplying one replaces it. Only `put`'s upsert rewrites those columns unconditionally, because an upsert restates the whole row.

`patch(id, fields)` is the unfenced surface for opaque fields — checkpoint, error, outcome, and metadata — and never moves `state`, `started_at_ms`, or `finished_at_ms`. Omitted fields are left as recorded. It returns `Patched` or `NotFound`. Fields such as response text, worktree pointers, or cache flags belong in `meta`; the fenced lifecycle stays with `put`/`heartbeat`/`finish`.

`AttemptStore` exports SQL `make`/`layer` plus no-op test seams.

## Redaction stops at the journal

Journal payloads are redacted on write; the stores that hold *executable*
state are deliberately not. `RunStore.state_json` is decoded and re-entered on
every resume, an `AttemptStore` checkpoint is handed back to the retrying step,
and an outcome is returned verbatim as the replayed result. A name-suffix
redactor there is silent corruption, not defence: a legitimate `pageToken`
resumes as `"[REDACTED]"` and the flow reads the wrong page, and a non-string
field like `clientSecret: { … }` becomes a string, so schema decode of the
persisted state dies and the run is undrivable (issue #72). These stores
therefore take no `redact` option at all — `RunStore.layer` and
`AttemptStore.layer` round-trip their columns byte-for-byte. See the
[`@smthrs/journal` reference](journal.md) for the write-side rules.

## Entry points

The root holds the stores and their contracts, all written against the
driver-neutral `@smthrs/database` service, and it bundles for the browser
(`pnpm run browser`). The test double binds a Node SQLite database and is
therefore imported from `@smthrs/run-store/test/TestRunStore`. A consumer that
needs the journal, the run store, and the step cache over ONE database takes
`@smthrs/engine-store/test/TestStores`. See
[browser support](../architecture/browser-support.md).

## Migrations

`Migrations.set` is this package's namespaced migration set — `flows_runs`,
its three indexes, and `flows_attempts` — and reserves migration id block
`1000`. `Migrations.run` / `Migrations.layer` install it alone;
`@smthrs/engine-store/Migrations` composes it with the journal's, the step
cache's, and the engine's. See
[`@smthrs/database`](database.md) for the composition rules.

See [Run ownership](../../../docs/specs/Concepts/Run%20Ownership.md), the
[`@smthrs/journal` reference](journal.md), and the
[`@smthrs/engine-store` reference](engine-store.md).
