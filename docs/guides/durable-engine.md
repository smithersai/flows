# Assembling a durable engine

This guide describes the services required by `@smthrs/engine-store` and gives a local SQL-backed composition pattern. It also identifies which services must be replaced before a multi-process deployment is durable.

## Required services

`EngineStore.make` requires:

- `Journal`, `RunStore`, `AttemptStore`, and `CacheStore`
- `DurableEngineState`
- kernel `Jj`
- `StepBoundary`
- an Effect `Scope`

`TestStores.layer()` supplies the four SQL services — journal, run, attempt, and cache — over ONE in-memory SQLite database. It is useful for integration tests, not restart durability:

```ts
import { DurableEngineState, EngineStore, StepBoundary } from "@smthrs/engine-store"
import * as TestStores from "@smthrs/engine-store/test/TestStores"
import { Jj } from "@smthrs/kernel"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"

const jj = Jj.make({
  snapshot: () => Effect.succeed({ changeId: "local" as never }),
  restore: () => Effect.void,
  diff: () => Effect.succeed(""),
  workspaceAdd: () => Effect.void,
  workspaceForget: () => Effect.void,
  status: () => Effect.succeed("")
})

const Requirements = Layer.mergeAll(
  TestStores.layer(),
  DurableEngineState.layerMemory,
  StepBoundary.layerTest(),
  Layer.succeed(Jj.Jj, jj)
)

const EngineLayer = EngineStore.layer({
    owner: { hostId: "local-worker" },
    journalSource: "local-engine",
    isAlive: () => Effect.succeed(false)
}).pipe(Layer.provide(Requirements))
```

`EngineLayer` provides the `FlowEngine` service. Merge it with flow handler layers, then run flow operations inside the resulting layer scope.

## Persistent SQL composition

For a persistent deployment:

1. create a compatible Effect `SqlClient`,
2. wrap it with `DurableWriter.make` or a runtime adapter,
3. run `Journal.Migrations`,
4. construct `SqlJournal`, `RunStore`, `AttemptStore`, and `CacheStore` from that database,
5. construct `DurableEngineState.layer` from the same migrated database,
6. provide the resulting services to `EngineStore.layer`.

Migrations must complete before any store service is exposed. `DurableWriter.write` wraps a SQL transaction and retries retryable SQLite write failures; non-SQLite drivers retain their own transaction behavior.

## Services still owned by the application

Use `DurableEngineState.layer` for process-restart durability.
`DurableEngineState.layerMemory` remains intended for tests. On flow
registration, the SQL implementation re-arms every pending future or overdue
clock and re-delivers wakes for stored completions through the normal run
claim path.

`StepBoundary.layerTest` does not create a sandbox. `StepBoundary.layer` can
measure declared paths and materialize outputs, but cannot observe writes
elsewhere in the tree, so its results are not admitted to the shared cache.
Supply a stronger boundary that enforces declared writes and returns
`wholeTreeWritesVerified: true` before admitting cross-run cache entries.

`EngineStore` mints its owner identity through the `OwnerIdentity` service rather than reading `node:crypto.randomUUID` and `process.pid` directly, so the composition itself is edge-safe: the default draws an incarnation number from `Random` where the platform has no process, and `OwnerIdentity.layerConstant` pins the whole token where a host already holds a lease. What is still **Planned** is a browser SQL client behind the `DurableWriter` contract — without one there is nothing for the composition to run against off Node.

## Ownership and liveness

Give each worker a stable `hostId`; the engine adds process identity and a random nonce for each engine instance. `isAlive` must return trustworthy evidence about another owner. Returning `false` unconditionally, as in tests, permits immediate takeover and is unsafe in a real multi-worker deployment.

## Wake behavior

Deferred and clock completion schedule a resume. A committed journal-driven `resumeSignal` is not implemented, so suspended execution can also rely on the flow engine’s polling schedule.

## Abandoned runs are not auto-resumed

**Nothing in this release watches for runs whose owner died and starts a process to pick them up.** `@smthrs/gateway`'s `SuperviseRuntime` declares the `scan`/`resume` supervision contract but ships only `make`, `makeNoop`, and `layerNoop` (`packages/gateway/src/SuperviseRuntime.ts:121,129,142`) plus a test double; there is no production implementation, and `@smthrs/gateway` is an agent-group package that the engine release train does not pack.

Recovery is scoped to a process that is already running the engine and has the flow registered. Each engine driver sweeps on the one-second heartbeat cadence (`packages/run-store/src/Heartbeat.ts:24`): it delivers pending cancels to parked runs, and it enumerates `running` rows whose heartbeat is older than the 30-second stale cutoff (`Heartbeat.ts:33`), re-driving up to 64 per tick through the ordinary claim/steal path (`packages/engine-store/src/internal/RunDriver.ts:160,1412`). That is what reclaims a SIGKILLed or OOM-killed owner's run. A wake for a flow the sweeping process has not registered logs a once-per-run warning and leaves the row parked for a worker that does register it (`RunDriver.ts:1074`).

To resume abandoned runs manually:

1. Start or restart a host process composed through `@smthrs/flows/NodeRuntime`, pointed at the same SQLite `filename`.
2. Pass a `registerFlows` layer that registers every flow with stored runs. It is the composition's final startup phase, so nothing resumes before its flow exists in the process.
3. Supply an `Options.isAlive` that reports the dead owner as not alive. Steal is gated on that answer; while it says the previous owner lives, its runs are not taken over.
4. Wait out the stale window. There is no command to invoke.

The 30-second cutoff is when a row becomes *eligible*, not when it is reclaimed. The steal predicate is strict (`heartbeat_at_ms < now - 30s`, `packages/run-store/src/RunStore.ts:1184`), the sweep that acts on it runs once per second, and one tick wakes at most 64 stale rows, oldest heartbeat first. So the earliest re-drive is the first tick after the heartbeat passes 30 seconds, and a run sitting behind a backlog of more than 64 stale rows waits for a later tick. `isAlive` gates the steal on top of that. Do not treat 30 seconds as an upper bound on recovery.

A run with no such process running stays put. Its state is durable and it does not advance.
