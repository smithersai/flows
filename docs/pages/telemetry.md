# Telemetry

How an application exports what the stores already measure. The spans and counters described in [Observability](/observability) exist whether or not anything exports them; this page is the wiring that sends them to an OpenTelemetry collector.

## One layer

`@smthrs/observability` composes Effect's own OTLP logger, metrics exporter, and tracer (`effect/unstable/observability`) into one layer with the flows service identity as the default resource. It depends on `effect` alone: no OpenTelemetry SDK is involved, and nothing in it resolves a `node:` built-in, so the same entry point bundles for Node and for the browser.

```typescript
import * as Otlp from "@smthrs/observability/Otlp"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const Telemetry = Otlp.layerFetch({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:4318",
  serviceName: "my-app", // defaults to "flows"
  serviceVersion: "1.2.3"
})

const program = Effect.log("telemetry online")
const main = program.pipe(Effect.provide(Telemetry))

Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(main))
```

That is the whole wiring. Spans opened through `Effect.fn` and `Effect.withSpan` reach `/v1/traces`, `Metric` counters reach `/v1/metrics` on the export interval and on shutdown, and log lines reach `/v1/logs`. The layer's scope owns the export fibers, so closing the application scope flushes and stops them. There is no unsubscribe to remember.

Three layers cover the deployment shapes:

| Layer | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `Otlp.layerFetch(options)` | the default: export over the host's global `fetch` (Node 22, every browser) |
| `Otlp.layer(options)` | the same wiring minus the HTTP client, for a host that provides its own `HttpClient`, for example Undici via `@smthrs/platform-node`'s `NodeHttpClient` |
| `Otlp.layerNoop` | no collector: provides nothing, so wiring code switches layers rather than branches |

### Options

| Option | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | collector endpoint; signals post to `/v1/logs`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/traces` below it | required |
| `serviceName` | the `service.name` resource attribute | `"flows"` |
| `serviceVersion` | the `service.version` resource attribute | the flows release version |
| `attributes` | extra resource attributes on every signal | none |
| `headers` | headers on every export request, for example vendor auth | none |
| `exportInterval` | export cadence for all three signals | Effect's per-signal defaults |
| `shutdownTimeout` | bound on the shutdown flush | Effect's default |

Operators who configure through the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables can use Effect's `Otlp.layerFromConfig` from `effect/unstable/observability` directly. It reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, per-signal endpoints, and `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`, and requires `OTEL_{LOGS,METRICS,TRACES}_EXPORTER=otlp` to enable each signal. Provide it an `HttpClient` (for example `FetchHttpClient.layer`) and pass the same resource options.

## What arrives

Traces are the spans listed in [Observability](/observability): every store operation, flow lifecycle step, and engine dispatch, connected across the durable queue boundary.

Metrics are the hot-path series the store packages define beside the code that updates them, one `<Service>Metrics` module per package:

| Counter | Attributes | Updated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flows_journal_writes` | `channel` = `durable` \| `lossy`; `receipt` = `accepted` \| `duplicate` \| `dropped` | `@smthrs/journal` `SqlJournal`, once per emission receipt |
| `flows_db_write_retries` | none | `@smthrs/database` `DurableWriter`, once per scheduled transaction replay after a transient conflict |
| `flows_run_claims` | `op` = `claim` \| `claim_and_own` \| `activate` \| `steal`; `outcome` = the operation's result tag in snake case | `@smthrs/run-store` `RunStore` |
| `flows_run_heartbeats` | `outcome` = `updated` \| `fence_lost` \| `not_found` | `RunStore.heartbeat`; `fence_lost` is the fencing event |
| `flows_run_transitions` | `outcome` = `transitioned` \| `fence_lost` \| `not_found` \| `guard_failed`; `to` = target status | `RunStore.transitionOwned` |
| `flows_step_cache_lookups` | `outcome` = `hit` \| `miss` | `@smthrs/step-cache` `CacheStore.get` |
| `flows_step_cache_puts` | `outcome` = `inserted` \| `existing_same` \| `conflict` | `CacheStore.put`, after the write transaction returns |
| `flows_artifact_puts` | none | `@smthrs/artifacts` local stores, once per successful put, dedupe included |
| `flows_artifact_gets` | none | once per successful digest-verified get; typed misses are error evidence, not throughput |
| `flows_engine_dispatches` | `outcome` = `success` \| `failure` \| `interrupt` | `@smthrs/engine-store` `ActionPersistence`, once per durable dispatch, cache-served and fresh alike |
| `flows_engine_scheduler_admissions` | none | `PlanScheduler`, once per admission pass that launched at least one dispatch |
| `flows_engine_scheduler_nodes` | `outcome` = `built` \| `clean` \| `failed` \| `skipped` \| `deferred` | `PlanScheduler`, once per node settlement |
| `flows_engine_sandbox_executions` | `outcome` = `success` \| `failure` \| `interrupt` | `WorkspaceSandbox.execute` |
| `flows_engine_sandbox_materializations` | `outcome` = `success` \| `failure` \| `interrupt` | `WorkspaceSandbox.materialize`, the one host write |
| `flows_engine_sandbox_conflicts` | none | copy-back preflight, once per compare-and-set refusal |
| `flows_engine_boundary_settlements` | `outcome` = `clean` \| `deviation` \| `violation` \| `refused` | the dispatch seam, once per boundary settle |
| `flows_engine_step_cache_decisions` | `outcome` = `verified_hit` \| `miss` \| `unverifiable_evidence` \| `unmeasurable` \| `stale_read_set` \| `replay_failed` | `ActionPersistence`, at most once per cache-consulting dispatch |
| `flows_engine_claims` | `outcome` = `activated` \| `terminal` \| `heartbeat_fresh` \| `steal_refused_owner_alive` \| `claim_lost` \| `activation_lost` | `RunDriver.claimAndActivate`, the engine-level decisions before and after the store CAS |

`flows_engine_step_cache_decisions` is counted where the decision takes effect: `verified_hit` as the cached result is served, a fall-through outcome as the dispatch proceeds to the real execution. A dispatch that fails or is fenced out mid-decision (a journal failure on the provenance emit, a strict corruption verdict) records no decision; its exit lands in `flows_engine_dispatches` instead. Unlike `flows_step_cache_lookups`, this counter is the effective reuse-or-fall-through decision.

Durations are `Metric.timer` histograms recorded through Effect's `Effect.trackDuration` (monotonic clock; success, failure, and interruption alike):

| Timer | Measures |
| --- | --- |
| `flows_engine_dispatch_duration` | one durable dispatch, admission through settlement |
| `flows_engine_scheduler_dispatch_duration` | one scheduler dispatch, admission through terminal event, rebase turns included |
| `flows_engine_sandbox_execution_duration` | one isolated workspace execution |
| `flows_engine_sandbox_materialization_duration` | one copy-back |

The handles are exported (`JournalMetrics`, `RunStoreMetrics`, `CacheStoreMetrics`, `ArtifactStoreMetrics`, `DatabaseMetrics`, `EngineStoreMetrics`), so a program can read them with `Metric.value` without an exporter at all.

:::warning
Read an outcome-dimensioned counter through its exported attribute view (`CacheStoreMetrics.hit`, `EngineStoreMetrics.dispatch.Success`), not through the bare counter handle. `Metric.value` reads the series for the exact attribute set on the handle, and the packages update only the tagged series, so the bare handle's attribute-less series stays at zero.

## Testing without a network

Updates resolve the metric registry from the running Effect context, so a test provides a fresh registry and reads it back with no exporter and no network:

```typescript
import { CacheStoreMetrics } from "@smthrs/step-cache"
import { assert, it } from "@effect/vitest"
import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"

it.effect("records cache hits", () =>
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const hits = yield* program.pipe(
      Effect.andThen(Metric.value(CacheStoreMetrics.hit)),
      Effect.provideService(Metric.MetricRegistry, new Map())
    )

    assert.strictEqual(hits.count, 1)
  }))
```

The exporter itself is testable the same way: `Otlp.layerFetch` reads its `fetch` from the `FetchHttpClient.Fetch` reference, so a test provides a recording stub and asserts on the OTLP request bodies. `packages/observability/test/Otlp.test.ts` does exactly this.
