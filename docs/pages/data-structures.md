# Data structures

Everything durable in Smithers Flows is one of a small number of shapes. This page names each shape, says where it lives, who writes it, who reads it, and which invariants hold. Read it before the per-package API pages: those tables list exports, this one explains what the exports move around.

## Where the shapes live

| Shape | Table | Migration | Package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Journal entry | `flows_journal_events` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/journal` |
| Journal checkpoint | `flows_journal_checkpoints` | `0002_checkpoints` | `@smthrs/journal` |
| Run row | `flows_runs` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/run-store` |
| Attempt row | `flows_attempts` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/run-store` |
| Cache row | `flows_step_cache` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/step-cache` |
| Deferred completion | `flows_deferred_completions` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/engine-store` |
| Clock deadline | `flows_clock_deadlines` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/engine-store` |
| Run-parent edge | `flows_run_parents` | created by `DurableEngineState.make` | `@smthrs/engine-store` |
| Plan row | `flows_plans` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/plan` |
| Plan node | `flows_plan_nodes` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/plan` |
| Plan edge | `flows_plan_edges` | `0001_initial` | `@smthrs/plan` |
| Frame snapshot | `flows_time_travel_snapshots` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | `@smthrs/time-travel` |
| Lineage edge | `flows_time_travel_edges` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | `@smthrs/time-travel` |
| Rewind audit | `flows_time_travel_audits` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | `@smthrs/time-travel` |
| Compensation receipt | `flows_time_travel_receipts` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | `@smthrs/time-travel` |
| Archived entry | `flows_time_travel_archive` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | `@smthrs/time-travel` |

Two shapes are in-memory only: the action step keys the engine derives, which are recomputed on every replay, and sync frames, which exist on the wire. A compiled plan's node keys are different: they are computed once at plan time and persisted in `flows_plan_nodes`.

## Journal entries

A submitted event is a `JournalEvent.Input`. A committed one is a `JournalEvent.Entry`.

```ts
new JournalEvent.Input({
  runId: "run-42" as JournalEvent.RunId,
  sourceId: "worker-a" as JournalEvent.SourceId,
  sourceSeq: 0 as JournalEvent.SourceSeq,
  eventType: "example.completed",
  payload: { value: 42 },
  meta: { lineageId: "root" }
})
```

| Field | Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runId` | `run_id` | which run this entry orders under |
| `seq` | `seq` | canonical order within one run, assigned at commit |
| `eventId` | `event_id` | `makeEventId(runId, sourceId, sourceSeq)`, unique across the table |
| `sourceId` | `source_id` | producer identity |
| `sourceSeq` | `source_seq` | producer-local order, unique per `(runId, sourceId)` |
| `emittedAtMs` | `emitted_at_ms` | writer clock |
| `eventType` | `event_type` | open string, indexed |
| `payload` | `payload_json` | application-defined |
| `meta` | `meta_json` | application-defined |

Invariants:

- `(run_id, seq)` is the primary key, and `(run_id, source_id, source_seq)` is unique. An exact retry of one producer identity collapses onto the original `seq` and returns `Duplicate`.
- Reusing a producer identity with different content fails with `idempotency_conflict`.
- Sequence numbers may have holes. A rejected or dropped admission still consumes its number, so consumers treat `seq` as an ordered cursor rather than a contiguous counter.
- There is no global order across runs.
- `payload` and `meta` pass through the single `Redaction` chokepoint on encode. Executable state does not: run state, attempt checkpoints, outcomes, errors, and cache results round-trip verbatim, because rewriting them would resume a flow with the wrong data.

### The two channels

| Channel | Entry point | Durability | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| durable | `emitDurable` | allocates and commits inside the write transaction; returns after COMMIT | lifecycle evidence, anything a recovery argument cites |
| lossy | `emitLossy` | bounded non-blocking queue; returns before COMMIT | telemetry where a drop is acceptable |

:::warning
An `Accepted` receipt from the lossy queue means the event entered the writer queue. A crash can still lose it.
:::

Overflow behavior is explicit:

| Policy | Full queue |
| --- | --- |
| `reject` | fail with `queue_overflow` |
| `drop-newest` | return `Dropped` |
| `drop-oldest` | evict one queued event, return `Accepted` with eviction evidence |

### Writers and readers

The writer is one scoped fiber inside `SqlJournal.layer`, persisting batches through `DurableWriter.write`. Published entries reach the general `changes` subscription and the per-run wake channels that `stream` follows, and publication is deferred until the outermost transaction commits.

Readers: `Journal.entries` pages history, `Journal.stream` replays then follows, `Journal.project` folds a stream through a deterministic reducer with no separate durable state, `@smthrs/sync` replicates entries to followers, and `@smthrs/time-travel` reads suffixes and archives them.

### Event types the engine writes

| Event type | Written by |
| --- | --- |
| `flows.engine.run-decision` | run-row transitions |
| `flows.engine.attempt-started`, `flows.engine.attempt-finished` | attempt lifecycle |
| `flows.engine.cache-provenance`, `flows.engine.cache-conflict`, `flows.engine.cache-corruption` | cache admission and its failures |
| `flows.engine.snapshot-identified` | compensable pre-image capture |
| `flows.engine.hard-violation`, `flows.engine.expected-set-deviation` | step-boundary settle |
| `flows.engine.deferred-completed`, `flows.engine.clock-scheduled` | durable primitives |
| `flows.engine.interrupted` | cancellation and interrupt release |
| `flows.kernel.grant.once.v1`, `.run.v1`, `.remembered.v1`, `.denied.v1`, `.envelope.v1` | `JournalGrantStore` |
| `flows.time-travel.effect-boundary` | `EffectBoundary.guard` |

## Run rows

`RunStore.RunRow` is control state, written directly by compare-and-swap. It is not derived from the journal.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run_id` | primary key, the execution id |
| `status` | `pending`, `running`, `suspended`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
| `created_at_ms`, `started_at_ms`, `finished_at_ms` | lifecycle stamps |
| `owner_host_id`, `owner_pid`, `owner_nonce`, `heartbeat_at_ms` | the ownership fence |
| `claim_host_id`, `claim_pid`, `claim_nonce`, `claimed_at_ms` | the claim generation |
| `state_json` | encoded payload and, once terminal, the encoded `Flow.Result` |
| `parent_run_id`, `cancel_requested_at_ms` | lineage and cancellation guards |
| `waiting_reason`, `waiting_wake_at_ms`, `waiting_token` | parked-run query and wake data |

Invariants, enforced by table `CHECK` constraints rather than by convention:

- A `running` row has all four owner fields set. Any other status has all four `NULL`. Moving to `suspended` or a terminal status therefore clears ownership atomically with the transition.
- The four claim fields are all set or all `NULL`.
- The lifecycle is `pending → running → completed | failed | suspended | cancelled`, and `suspended → running` on a wake.

Ownership constants live in `Ownership`: a 1 second heartbeat interval, a 19 second write tolerance, and a 30 second stale threshold. The write tolerance is eleven ticks shorter than the steal cutoff, so an owner whose heartbeat writes fail is always interrupted before a peer may take over.

:::warning
Takeover also requires `LivenessEvidence`. Elapsed time alone does not prove an owner is dead.
:::

### Waiting rows

A parked run carries a reason. `DurableEngineState.park` writes it, `wake` clears it, and `waitingRuns` is what a sweeper enumerates.

| Reason | Source |
| --- | --- |
| declared, for example `approval` or `quota` | `FlowRuntime.annotateWaiting` |
| `timer` | the earliest clock deadline |
| `event` | anything else |

An annotation is consumed once its awaited deferred resolves, so a later suspension parks under its own reason rather than a replayed one.

## Attempt rows

An attempt is addressed by `(runId, stepKeyDigest, attempt)`, where `stepKeyDigest` is the result of decoding the step key through `Sha256`.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | the configurable in-progress vocabulary, then a terminal state |
| `started_at_ms`, `finished_at_ms`, `heartbeat_at_ms` | lifecycle stamps |
| `checkpoint_json` | up to 1 MiB; omitting one preserves the previous checkpoint |
| `error_json`, `outcome_json` | the encoded exit |
| `meta_json` | opaque, and where the `FileBoundary` is carried |

Invariants: mutations are fenced by the current run owner, and the first fenced terminal transition wins. A later `finish` observes `StateChanged`. A persisted `failed` row replays by rethrowing the persisted domain failure, so a non-retryable failure matches on resume without another dispatch.

## Cache rows

`flows_step_cache` maps a digest to a result. Writes are first-writer-wins.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `key_digest` | primary key, the `Sha256` transformation of the step key |
| `result_json` | the encoded action success |
| `meta_json` | opaque metadata |
| `created_at_ms` | creation stamp |
| `recorded_run_id`, `recorded_event_seq` | journal provenance |

| Put outcome | When |
| --- | --- |
| `Inserted` | no row existed |
| `ExistingSame` | a row existed with equal content |
| `Conflict` | a row existed with different content |

A `Conflict` is journalled as `flows.engine.cache-conflict` and handed to `Inconsistency`. The unwired core default is strict: journal, then fail the run.

## Step keys

A step key is `key1_` followed by a lowercase SHA-256 digest. It is computed in `@smthrs/engine` above the encoded storage seam, so the memory and durable engines receive the same identity.

### Canonical serialization

Decoding through `Canonical` produces RFC 8785 JSON. The wrapped `canonicalize` library sorts object keys, preserves array order, uses deterministic number formatting, and rejects inputs that cannot produce valid canonical JSON. The wrapper additionally rejects lone Unicode surrogates. `Key` hashes that canonical document through Effect Crypto.

### Cache keys

```ts
yield* Schema.decodeUnknownEffect(Key)({ operation: "compile", version: 3 })
```

A sealed action key changes when its caller identity, complete cache environment, or filesystem boundary changes. The engine owns that combined input; `@smthrs/keys` only hashes it.

A string `idempotencyKey` folds in the action name and declared schemas. An object identity is caller-owned and rename-stable.

If no complete environment is declared, the key includes the current execution ID and cannot be reused across runs.

### Invocation keys

```ts
{ runId: "run-42", parentScope: "checkout", ordinal: 3, tier: "compensable" }
```

The engine hashes this private shape through `Key`. Ordinals are allocated per declaration identity, meaning the action name refined by any declared key, and that scope is folded into the key as `parentScope`.

## Frames and time-travel shapes

```ts
const frame: Frame.Frame = { lineageId: "build-42/root", seq: 17 }
```

A frame names a durable point by lineage plus journal sequence. The stores hold:

| Shape | Columns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snapshot | `run_id`, `lineage_id`, `seq`, `change_id` | the jj change a frame maps to |
| Lineage edge | `parent_run_id`, `parent_seq`, `child_run_id` (unique), `kind`, `attached` | `kind` is `child`, `fork`, or `continuation` |
| Audit | `id`, `run_id`, `lineage_id`, `seq`, `status`, `rate_limit_json`, `detail_json` | one rewind attempt |
| Receipt | `id`, `audit_id`, `effect_id`, `receipt_json` | one compensation outcome |
| Archive | the full journal-entry columns plus `archived_at_ms` | the truncated suffix, moved rather than deleted |

Rewind archives and truncates the suffix in one transaction, so an interrupted rewind is recoverable at startup rather than leaving a half-erased history.

## Sync messages

Sync shapes are on the wire, never in a table.

| Shape | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Scope` | `Run` with a `runId`, or `Workspace` |
| `RunCursor` | `runId` plus `afterSeq` |
| `WorkspaceCursor` | an array of run cursors |
| `ReadRequest` / `ReadResponse` | scope, cursor, limit; entries plus the next cursor |
| `SubscribeRequest` | scope, cursors, and a credit count |
| `EntriesFrame` | entries plus the next cursor |
| `HeartbeatFrame` | emitted when no entries arrive |
| `ClosedFrame` | the single terminal frame |

Because journal sequences may have holes, `afterSeq` means entries after this number. Credit bounds the frames one subscription emits. There is no acknowledgement RPC, so a client that needs more opens another subscription from its last durable cursor.

:::warning
Persist a returned cursor only after applying the batch that came with it.
:::

## The atomicity rule that ties these together

A state transition and the lifecycle entry describing it commit in one write transaction, opened by `Journal.transact`. Every store above writes through the same `DurableWriter`, so their writes join that transaction as savepoints. Either both halves are durable or neither is. [Internal details](/internals) lists the exact pairs and what follows from them.
