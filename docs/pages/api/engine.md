# @smthrs/engine

The runtime that executes flows: the low-level encoded engine contract, its typed adapter onto `@smthrs/flow`'s `FlowRuntime` port, execution-instance state, the in-memory implementation, and the generated RPC/HTTP flow façades.

```ts
import { FlowEngine } from "@smthrs/engine"
import { Action, Flow, Interpreter } from "@smthrs/flow"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const Compile = Action.make("example/Compile", {
  payload: { target: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  tier: "sealed"
})

const Build = Flow.make("example/Build", {
  payload: { target: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  body: (payload) => Compile.call(payload)
})

const layer = Layer.mergeAll(
  Compile.toLayer(({ target }) => Effect.succeed(`${target}.js`)),
  Interpreter.layer(Build)
).pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations), Layer.provideMerge(FlowEngine.layerMemory))
```

## Entry point

| Import | Source | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@smthrs/engine` | [src/index.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/flows/blob/main/packages/engine/src/index.ts) | any |

## FlowEngine

[src/FlowEngine](https://github.com/smithersai/flows/tree/main/packages/engine/src/FlowEngine)

The engine implements `FlowRuntime`, the port `@smthrs/flow` declares. The service tag, `FlowInstance`, `annotateWaiting`, and `FlowCycleDetected` live there; what this namespace owns is the implementation.

| Export | Kind | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Encoded` | interface | the storage-facing seam, including `actionExecute` |
| `ActionExecuteOptions` | interface | action, attempt, step key, tier |
| `SnapshotBoundary`, `SnapshotBoundaryOptions` | class + interface | compensable snapshot hooks |
| `makeInstance` | constructor | the initial per-execution state a runtime hands to a flow run |
| `makeUnsafe` | constructor | adapts an `Encoded` implementation into the typed `FlowRuntime` |
| `layerMemory` | layer | in-process engine with no durability |

## Flow proxies

| Export | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FlowProxy.toRpcGroup`, `toHttpApiGroup`, `ConvertRpcs`, `ConvertHttpApi` | [src/FlowProxy.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/flows/blob/main/packages/engine/src/FlowProxy.ts) | derives a client surface from flow definitions |
| `FlowProxyServer.layerRpcHandlers`, `layerHttpApi`, `RpcHandlers` | [src/FlowProxyServer.ts](https://github.com/smithersai/flows/blob/main/packages/engine/src/FlowProxyServer.ts) | serves those definitions |
