# Package structure

Twenty-three pnpm workspaces make up the engine group under `packages/`, one closed dependency set. This page is the map: who owns which data, which package may import which, and which entry points bundle for a browser.

## Workspaces

| Workspace | Directory | Published | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@smthrs/flows` | `packages/flows` | yes | nothing; re-exports the engine packages below as namespaces, but not the `platform-*` bundles |

| `@smthrs/capability` | `packages/capability` | yes | no tables; the capability vocabulary and typed permission failures, with their journaled schema ids |
| `@smthrs/kernel` | `packages/kernel` | yes | the closed host service list, capability sets, grants, and their journal records |
| `@smthrs/canonical` | `packages/canonical` | yes | no tables; RFC 8785 canonical JSON |
| `@smthrs/crypto` | `packages/crypto` | yes | no tables; injected cryptographic operations |
| `@smthrs/keys` | `packages/keys` | yes | no tables; canonical flow keys |
| `@smthrs/plan` | `packages/plan` | yes | `flows_plans`, `flows_plan_nodes`, `flows_plan_edges` |
| `@smthrs/artifacts` | `packages/artifacts` | yes | no tables; bytes addressed by their own SHA-256 digest |
| `@smthrs/flow` | `packages/flow` | yes | no tables; flow, action, and durable-primitive definitions plus the runtime port |
| `@smthrs/engine` | `packages/engine` | yes | no tables; the engine that executes them, and the RPC/HTTP façades |
| `@smthrs/engine-store` | `packages/engine-store` | yes | `flows_deferred_completions`, `flows_clock_deadlines`, `flows_run_parents` |
| `@smthrs/sync` | `packages/sync` | yes | no tables; a wire protocol over journal entries |
| `@smthrs/time-travel` | `packages/time-travel` | yes | `flows_time_travel_snapshots`, `_edges`, `_audits`, `_receipts`, `_archive` |
| `@smthrs/observability` | `packages/observability` | yes | no tables; the default OTLP exporter layer over Effect's own observability modules |
| `@smthrs/examples` | `examples` | no | the runnable example suite |

Every published manifest is `0.1.0`, every internal production range is an exact `0.1.0`, and `effect` is pinned to exact `4.0.0-rc.108`.

## Who owns which data

Six packages create schema, in three different ways. Knowing which is which keeps a table in its owning package.

| Owner | Mechanism | Tables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@smthrs/journal` | `0001_initial` and `0002_checkpoints`, run by `Migrations.layer` | `flows_journal_events`, `flows_journal_checkpoints` |
| `@smthrs/run-store` | `0001_initial`, run by `Migrations.layer` | `flows_runs`, `flows_attempts` |
| `@smthrs/step-cache` | `0001_initial`, run by `Migrations.layer` | `flows_step_cache` |
| `@smthrs/plan` | `0001_initial`, run by `Migrations.layer`; append-only triggers created with the tables | `flows_plans`, `flows_plan_nodes`, `flows_plan_edges` |
| `@smthrs/engine-store` | `0001_initial`; its `Migrations.layer` composes the journal, run-store, step-cache, and plan sets with its own, plan's last | `flows_deferred_completions`, `flows_clock_deadlines` |
| `@smthrs/engine-store` | statements issued by `DurableEngineState.make` at construction | `flows_run_parents`, its index, the `flows_run_parents_gc` trigger, the stale-running partial index |
| `@smthrs/time-travel` | `SqlTimeTravelStore.migrate` | snapshots, lineage edges, audits, receipts, archive |

Each storage package exports its migration set from its own `Migrations` module, and `@smthrs/database`'s `Migrations` composes them over one `flows_migrations` table: a set declares a `namespace` that prefixes its migration names and an `idOffset` that reserves a block of migration ids, so two packages' `0001_initial` land on distinct identities and a mis-declared package fails the migration instead of silently shadowing a table. The blocks are journal `0`, run store `1000`, step cache `2000`, engine store `3000`, and plan `4000`. `@smthrs/engine-store/Migrations` is the composed list an engine installs, and it puts the plan set last because a `Migrator` decides what to run from a single high-water mark, so a set whose ids sit below an already-applied one would be assumed done.

The engine-store statements sit outside its migration deliberately, because the package creates them when its layer is built. They are inventoried in `packages/engine-store/src/internal/EngineStateSchema.ts` with the dialects each one is known to accept, and a catalog-diff test fails when new DDL appears without an inventory entry.

## Dependency graph

The table below is the reference; the diagram is the same edges drawn out. An arrow means the left package imports the right one.

`pnpm run circular` fails the build on an import cycle, within a package or across them.

The one cycle at *package* granularity is `kernel` ↔ `platform-browser`: the kernel's deterministic `TestHost` bundle (a test-only subpath) mounts the browser filesystem and interpreter, and `BrowserChildProcessSpawner` renders command lines with the kernel's `CommandLine`. Removing `HttpTransport` cut the network half of it: `BrowserHost` now provides Effect's own `HttpClient` and no longer fills a kernel-owned slot. No module-level cycle exists, which is what `pnpm run circular` checks.

## Entry point matrix

A package root exports contracts. A platform implementation lives under a subpath named for its platform, the way `effect` keeps `@effect/platform-node` out of `effect`. A root that re-exports an implementation resolves that implementation's imports for every consumer, including browser ones, before any bundler can tree-shake it.

`scripts/browser-check.mjs` executes this table. It bundles each browser entry point with esbuild `platform: "browser"` and fails if one breaks, and it bundles each Node entry point and fails if one stops failing. `pnpm run browser` runs it locally and CI runs it as a step.

| Entry point | Browser | Node | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@smthrs/platform-browser` | yes | yes | browser `FileSystem` and `ChildProcessSpawner`, and the `BrowserHost` bundle over effect's own fetch `HttpClient` |
| `@smthrs/platform-browser/BrowserHost` | yes | yes | `layer({ bash, fs, jj })` over an injected browser filesystem, interpreter, and compiled `flows_jj.wasm`; all five tags real |
| `@smthrs/platform-node` | no | yes | child processes, Node filesystem, Jujutsu |
| `@smthrs/platform-bun` | no | yes | the Bun adapters, falling back to `@effect/platform-node` off Bun |
| `@smthrs/kernel/test/TestHost` | no | yes | `effect/testing`'s `TestClock` imports `node:assert` |
| `@smthrs/jj` | yes | yes | the `Jj` contract, `JjError`, and the no-op layer |
| `@smthrs/jj/browser/BrowserJj` | yes | yes | jj-lib as `wasm32-wasip1` over an injected virtual filesystem; `layerUnsupported` is the no-module fallback |
| `@smthrs/jj/node/NodeJj`, `@smthrs/jj/bun/BunJj` | no | yes | spawn the jj CLI through `node:child_process` |
| `@smthrs/sandbox` | yes | yes | provider adaptation and the liveness probe; no host access of its own |
| `@smthrs/capability` | yes | yes | capability vocabulary and typed permission failures |
| `@smthrs/kernel` | yes | yes | capabilities, grants, decorated services |
| `@smthrs/canonical` | yes | yes | RFC 8785 canonical JSON schema |
| `@smthrs/crypto` | yes | yes | injected cryptographic schemas |
| `@smthrs/keys` | yes | yes | canonical flow-key schema |
| `@smthrs/plan` | yes | yes | plan compilation, the authoring AST, the diff, and the plan store over the `DurableWriter` contract |
| `@smthrs/artifacts` | yes | yes | the content-addressed artifact store, local and remote |
| `@smthrs/database` | yes | yes | the driver-neutral contract only |
| `@smthrs/database/node/NodeDatabase` | no | yes | `node:sqlite` through `@effect/sql-sqlite-node` |
| `@smthrs/database/test/TestDatabase` | no | yes | in-memory SQLite through the same driver |
| `@smthrs/journal` | yes | yes | the journal and its migration over `SqlClient` and the `DurableWriter` contract |
| `@smthrs/journal/test/TestJournal` | no | yes | composes `TestDatabase` |
| `@smthrs/run-store` | yes | yes | run and attempt stores over the same contracts |
| `@smthrs/run-store/test/TestRunStore` | no | yes | composes `TestDatabase` |
| `@smthrs/step-cache` | yes | yes | the step cache over the same contracts |
| `@smthrs/step-cache/test/TestCacheStore` | no | yes | composes `TestDatabase` |
| `@smthrs/flow` | yes | yes | flow, action, durable primitives, retry, identity |
| `@smthrs/engine` | yes | yes | the engine that executes flows, plus the RPC/HTTP façades |
| `@smthrs/engine-store` | yes | yes | the durable engine; owner identity enters through `OwnerIdentity` |
| `@smthrs/sync` | yes | yes | protocol and client and server over RPC |
| `@smthrs/time-travel` | yes | yes | frames, replay, fork, rewind, compensation, recovery |
| `@smthrs/observability` | yes | yes | OTLP logs, metrics, and traces layers over Effect's `HttpClient`; the fetch variant binds the host's global `fetch` |
| `@smthrs/flows` | yes | yes | re-exports every engine package |

Twenty-three entry points bundle for the browser.

:::warning[Bundling is a weaker claim than running]
`@smthrs/journal`, `@smthrs/run-store`, `@smthrs/step-cache`, and `@smthrs/plan` bundle because they depend on the `DurableWriter` contract. A browser application still has to supply a browser SQL client, such as Effect's sqlite-wasm OPFS worker, to that contract. No such layer ships here.
:::

The accurate sentence is that canonical JSON, crypto, the host contracts, `BrowserHost`, keys, plan, artifacts, capability, kernel, sandbox, database, journal, run store, step cache, flow, engine, engine-store, the barrel, sync, time travel, and the OTLP exporter bundle for the browser, and the durable engine composition is still SQLite-on-Node first because no browser SQL client layer ships here. `@smthrs/engine-store`'s last two `node:`-flavoured reads (`process.pid` and `node:crypto` `randomUUID`) moved behind the `OwnerIdentity` service, which closed issue #114.

## Build shape

Every published package builds a dual module surface: `dist/esm/index.js`, `dist/esm/index.d.ts`, and `dist/cjs/index.js`, named by a conditional `publishConfig.exports` map with `./internal/*` blocked. `scripts/pack-release.mjs` packs and publishes the twenty-three engine-group workspaces from one dependency-ordered list, so a package cannot be published before something it depends on. Every package ships a byte-identical `LICENSE` in its `files` whitelist. `packages/flow` and `packages/engine` additionally ship `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, because they carry the two halves of a fork of Effect's unstable workflow surface; `packages/engine` also ships the `VENDOR.md` that records the fork for both.

New package modules mirror the Effect repository: file structure, module layout, `make` and `layer` naming, error conventions, and `@since` and `@category` JSDoc.
