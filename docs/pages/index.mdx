# Smithers Flows

Smithers Flows is an Effect-based durable-execution engine: typed flows that record every side effect to a journal, so a crashed process resumes from its recorded steps instead of starting over.

You declare an action once with Schema-typed payload, success, and error, attach its implementation as a layer, and write a flow whose pure body names it. The engine persists run state in SQLite through the journal, computes a content-addressed key for each action, and stores each attempt's encoded result. When a process restarts, it claims the run, re-plans the flow and drives it from the top, and replays every recorded step; the first step without a record is where new work happens. A capability kernel bounds what flow code can reach on the host, read-only sync streams journal entries to followers, and time travel forks and rewinds run history.

A build system remembers what it has done so it can skip it. A workflow engine remembers what it has done so it can resume it. The record is the same; only the reason differs. Flows keeps that record once, content-addressed, and gets both: finished work is skipped, and a crashed run picks up where it left off. [Comparisons](/comparisons) sets the implementation against TurboRepo, Nx, and Bazel.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.19 or later.

::::steps

### Install the packages

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @smthrs/flow @smthrs/engine effect
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @smthrs/flow @smthrs/engine effect
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @smthrs/flow @smthrs/engine effect
```

:::

### Declare an action, a flow, and their layers

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { FlowEngine } from "@smthrs/engine"
import { Action, Flow, Interpreter } from "@smthrs/flow"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

// The atom that does the work: schemas and a tag, no code.
export const Greet = Action.make("example/Greet", {
  payload: { name: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String
})

// The composite: a pure body that names the atom instead of calling it.
export const Greeting = Flow.make("example/Greeting", {
  payload: { name: Schema.String },
  success: Schema.String,
  body: (payload) => Greet.call(payload)
})

// The implementation is attached separately, where the code can run.
const GreetingLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
  Greet.toLayer(({ name }) => Effect.succeed(`Hello, ${name}.`)),
  Interpreter.layer(Greeting)
).pipe(
  Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations),
  Layer.provideMerge(FlowEngine.layerMemory),
  Layer.provideMerge(NodeCrypto.layer)
)

const program = Greeting.execute(
  { name: "Ada" },
  { executionId: "greeting-ada-1" }
).pipe(Effect.provide(GreetingLayer))

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
// "Hello, Ada."
```

### Make it durable

That engine keeps its state in the process. To survive a crash, drive the same flow with `EngineStore.layer` over SQLite. [Examples](/examples) walks the eleven runnable programs that do it, and `pnpm run test:examples` executes every one of them against the real packages.

## Packages

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@smthrs/flows` | umbrella barrel re-exporting the engine packages below as namespaces; the `platform-*` bundles are deliberately excluded |
| `@smthrs/canonical` | RFC 8785 canonical JSON as an Effect Schema |
| `@smthrs/platform-node` | the Node Host bundle: Effect's Node filesystem and child-process spawner, the Undici transport, and the Node jj adapter |
| `@smthrs/platform-bun` | the same bundle for Bun, over `@effect/platform-bun` |
| `@smthrs/jj` | jujutsu snapshot, restore, diff, and workspace operations as a host service |
| `@smthrs/sandbox` | a remote `ChildProcessSpawner` implementation and the sandbox liveness probe |
| `@smthrs/platform-browser` | browser `FileSystem` and `ChildProcessSpawner` over ZenFS and just-bash |
| `@smthrs/journal` | logical WAL, migrations, projections, redaction, the `OwnerId` fence |
| `@smthrs/run-store` | run and attempt stores, ownership arbitration, migrations |
| `@smthrs/step-cache` | the sealed step result cache and its migration |
| `@smthrs/database` | driver-neutral SQL contract with transactional write retry |
| `@smthrs/capability` | the capability vocabulary and typed permission failures, shared by the kernel and `@smthrs/jj` |
| `@smthrs/kernel` | capability sets, grants, and permission-decorated host services |
| `@smthrs/crypto` | injected cryptographic schema transformations |
| `@smthrs/keys` | canonical flow keys |
| `@smthrs/plan` | the keyed action graph, its authoring AST, its append-only store, and its diff |
| `@smthrs/artifacts` | the content-addressed artifact store, local and remote |
| `@smthrs/flow` | flow definitions, actions, durable primitives, retry policy |
| `@smthrs/engine` | the engine that executes them, plus the RPC and HTTP façades |
| `@smthrs/engine-store` | the durable engine: claims, fences, and persists runs over the journal |
| `@smthrs/sync` | read-only journal replication for followers |
| `@smthrs/time-travel` | replay, fork, rewind, compensation, and recovery protocols |

Packages are pre-1.0 at `0.1.0` in lockstep. Every engine package, including `@smthrs/engine-store` and the barrel, bundles for the browser. The `platform-node`, `platform-bun`, and driver subpaths are the deliberate Node-only entry points.
